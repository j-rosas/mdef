# First Experiments

This set of experiments started from the curiosity of growing almost anything and the use of efficient resources as a way to develop projects.

I chose the first role of prototyping, that starts from a very simple hypothesis and then turn it into an experiment that was possible to made almost in the moment or in a few days, with the minimum amount of resources.

The first experiment starts from the question of "Can I add value to some existing object, growing something into it?

The Second one was to replace an existing objects using the minimum amount of resources.

The third one aims to use the mechanical energy of living organisms to enable them to comunicate with humans when they move.(output)
