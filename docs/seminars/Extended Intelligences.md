Concepts:

-Artificial Intelligence as a tool.
##### Machine Learning: 

Automating tasks by providing examples, instead of writting instructions.

global architecture that can "self configurate" itself from examples provided. cna be images, text, audio, etc.)
works as inputs of information, creating outputs.
we have to define a task to automate, from different datasets.

##### Datasets:
