# Design Studio

1. Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on “your new me” and create a “new workspace”. 

2. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in (onion mapping from the Atlas) and add them to your design space.

3. Do your first design experiment applying one or different roles of prototyping.
