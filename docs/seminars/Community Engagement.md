## Reflections:

Communitites:

###### The interesting of looking for communities is the fact that you are not alone , not enven in your project or anything, its possible and much easier to embrace any project with the support of a specific community. We had recently done our design intervention, mixing nature, music and technology, the day before the intervention we found that there was a gathering here in Barcelona, to show projects related to sound art, we found it too late to participate, but it was very interesting that a community is allready working on that so it validates our work, and embrace us to talk and interact with more people.


From Ego to Eco:

###### The concept Ego to eco makes a lot of sense to me. As designers or creators, we start more often from our ego, doing projects that start from our most deeply interests(I think that is a very good way to start), and then we extrapolate them into someones need or oportunity. Turning this as a concept, make it much more evident that the ego is like a fuel to do things, but the ecosystem that we are interacting is the same or more valid to our projects.
