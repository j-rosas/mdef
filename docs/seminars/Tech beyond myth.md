We manage disasemble a Roomba Robot by team, It was a very interesting choice, because is a very multifuntional robot, that have motors, wheels and sensors. We find out that the Robot was much more simple that we imagine, when we resume the functions, in navigation, sensors, hardware, we manage to undertand the main function of it. Then We search for different parts online, to find out what they were, and look for info.
