##### Design as a mode of inquiry

In her Talk, Audrey showed us about their personal and professional project, using 1PP Tools and methodologies. 

She works mainly in Interaction design research and investigation. Using tools as autobiographical design, auto ethnography, and duo ethnography. 

A very interesting project was the process of making the van for living and travelling on it, sharing her reflections with a lot of detail, like a normal open source project. She made tutorials and upload them to insctructables, having coments of what she did. Also the use of video camera was very helful to register the process. And She also had a Daily diary, where she wrote all the observations and her feelings.

"There has to be a balance of what do you see and what do you see from the rest."

Some other projects were, the odd interpreters, related to unusual data recollection from normall and daily use products. In a way, the recollection of data works is like a window to another world and its understanding. She made an interesting point showing that natural observation leads to some very personal facts, and depending on the scale that the data its recollected, the results will change.

Tips for ethnography:

*-Commit to document*

*-Choose an enjoable format*

*-Wear many hats*

*-Make creative representation of data*
