##### Design as a mode of inquiry

In her Talk, Audrey showed us about their personal and professional project, using 1PP Tools and methodologies. 

She works mainly in Interaction design research and investigation. Using tools as autobiographical design, auto ethnography, and duo ethnography. 

A very interesting project was the process of making the van for living and travelling on it, sharing her reflections with a lot of detail, like a normal open source project. She made tutorials and upload them to insctructables, having coments of what she did. Also the use of video camera was very helful to register the process. And She also had a Daily diary, where she wrote all the observations and her feelings.

"There has to be a balance of what do you see and what do you see from the rest."

Some other projects were, the odd interpreters, related to unusual data recollection from normall and daily use products. In a way, the recollection of data works is like a window to another world and its understanding. She made an interesting point showing that natural observation leads to some very personal facts, and depending on the scale that the data its recollected, the results will change.

Tips for ethnography:

*-Commit to document*

*-Choose an enjoable format*

*-Wear many hats*

*-Make creative representation of data,*

*-Look for physical data*


2. Laura Forlano

She is a designer very interested in 1PP design research. She is diabetic, and that condition makes her consider herself as a kind of a cyborg, because she has to use a insulin sensor and pump when she is low on sugar.In her talk, She goes deep into her personal experiences and feelings, taking about her fears, and questioning her relation to this devices that sometimes is positives, but some times can be extreme negative as well.

In the talk she shows how AI, algorythms, and machine learning can better a very specific world that is the diabetes, and how that new concepts can help to improve the technology, but at the same time, the people can hack it, or turn it onto anything else.

A very interesting question from Laura is, what it means to be human? Because the limits of being human and live attached to a machine make that answer even more difficult, because you are living your life with a machine all your time.

Another subjects that she taks about, are theories of post humanism, transhumanism, and that we must define ourself as humans.s
