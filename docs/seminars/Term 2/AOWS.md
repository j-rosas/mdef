## Atlas of weak signals


**Reflection**

 I had found in AOWS a very important instance to hear and reflect in complex topics, like climate crisis, Blockchain, Hunger, Politics, etc. At first it was a bit overwhelming, because all the conversation leads to something catastrophic. 

Coming from Chile, We had another very good instance to talk about our background, nationality, and our local issues, I told about How Chile had Changed from the Social explosion from three years ago, to a Country that now is writing its own constitution by a democratic process. So is not all that bad.

Another things that I would like to see more, is more projects related to the Atlas of Weak signal, to be more an inspiring course, that a pessimist one. I know that its necessary to see the reality, and embrace it, but for the time I think that is also necessary to inspire people, students in this case. As we want to be agents of change today, In my opinion we need more Inspiration, instead of more bad news.

Another interesting conversation that we had was the Automatization related class. As we talk about jobs and which ones are in more danger to be extinct, I realized that our job as designers is at start, safe from automatization, because it envolves much more creativity so its difficult to simulate. The interesting thing is learning about GPT3 and how its changing the way of writing, that also was supposed to be a creative field, so its very interesting how the technology is changing, and moving forward without much thinking the “whys” of it. As designers I think that it’s 100% necessary to embrace, understand, and develop technology that will help us as tools to improve and make meaningful projects.
