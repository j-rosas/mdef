Distributed nature of design

Design as participation

History of the world in seven cheap things

This is distributed design

Abstract Joaquin Rosas.
At the end of 2015, back in Chile I presented my thesis project, It was called “Make care”, it was a set of 3d printed objects that were made to improve daily task (eating, higene, dress) for young people with Epidermolysis Bullosa( Butterfly skin). At that time I was not aware of the huge impact of what I was doing, The whole process of empathizing and working with someone completely different from you, designing by research, prototying and iterating with digital fabrication, made me embrace and internalize what design means in my life. For me is not only my profesional definition, its a way how I describe myself, being part of my personality, my daily acts, my life choices. Over time I have understand design as a way of living and being ecological(in matter of relation) with the world. In this paper I will show a bit deeply about this project, its impact, and how open and distributed technologies had opened an opportunity for a new kind of projects.
During the last three years, I have worked with very different people, from different countries, disciplines, ages, socioeconomical context, etc. In this journey of multidisciplinary collaboration, I have discovered that design can be understanded as many different ways, as an innovation driven discipline, as an creative statement, as a different way of living, or simply as a creative tool to develop something or to solve a problem.
In that context, I had realized that design can ́t go alone in the seek of the solving problems, or improve peoples lives. Its crucial and necessary to understand that we(designers) are allways part of a community, or a team that goes forward in group than alone. We are the creative and radical piece of the network, that drives the seek for new ways of tackling life.
I see in design/designers an amazing capability of change realities and futures, as we understand society and our community as organic systems that are in constant change. More complex and planetary topics as politics, economics, climate crisis, are been challenged by new ways of doing things and open technologies as Blockchain, Nft ́s, Crypto currency, digital fabrication, distributed design, Ai, etc. All these technologies are a glimpse of what will change in the next years to come, and the knowledge and practice of that technologies will become crucial at the moment of embrace
new projects that will challenge our present. Personally, as we are learning about new methodologies as 1PP, this will be the perfect time to make a cross between my personal needs and concerns and the local contexts that I will be part off. Avoiding cheapness its something that I have found very interesting related to the “7 cheap things” lecture, because the challenge to change or transform our traditional “capitalist” mindsets and how we live.
In this publication, I will show some examples about distributed and local projects that have impacted me during my careeer, and also some people that have inspired me to be the designer that I am now, focused on exploring my personal path and how that will change and improve my world by design.
