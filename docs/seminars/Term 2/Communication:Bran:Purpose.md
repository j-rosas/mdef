#### Branding:

Through history, it has been used as a brand, mark, showing authority or quality, as a symbol of identity.

#### Gloobal economies:

Make people buy or consume "life styles", or feelings, like happines, seriousness, etc. ItÂ´s Also a "Resume" of the meaning of the storytelling that we want to share

#### Futurama:

Showoff of possible futures back in the mid 30's, where the exhibitions were about cities of the furure, paid by General Motors, building narratives about how the car is the future of the cities, influencing millions of people to nbuy, use cars and shaping the future.


#### Examples: 

Redbull, Mcdonalds, Coke, Disney. They show experiences, lifestyles, but also publicity, when they show something new, they are not changing their base proces, normally they want to change mindsets to make people buy their products.

Mainly to contribute to our society and build better futures.

Name two believes and personal experiences that hold our purpose.

##### Statements:

1.- Multidisciplinar work, can improve lives. 

I have seen that statement becomign true, when I met the team of "take a hand", a Local enterprise based in Chile, focused on designing 3d printed prothesis to amputated people, or kids with badformation in their hand or legs. The team was made by designers, structural engeneers, material experts, psicologysts, and more. It was the first time that I truly experienced how a multidisciplinar local company works, getting very happy with the outcomes.

2.-Knowledge is better.

Last summer I visited some family friends in the deep south of Chile, The place was called "paul and konomis garden". It was a almost 100% self suficient place, where Paul and Konomi lived, teach, and work with nature. At a first sight, the house looked very "poor" because they didn't had electricity, bathroom, or any materiality stuff.(Only their Cellphones.) But when I started realizing that they manage to live(very well) there, knowing the times of their crops, how to manage the field, and to make almost anything the needed, I realized that the knowledge that they had working with nature, is muh more valuable than material stuf that we have or we think we need.
