##### Week 13

#### TERM 2

# Design Studio

**Teachers:**

Oscar Tomico

Tomás Vivanco

Mariana Quintero


#### Goals for the second term:

-Grow our community

-Project bottoms up

-Refine personal Identity

-Learn of new materials and tools




#### Three learnings from the first term:

##### 1. The Magic machine. 

The magic machine exersice looking it from now, was a groundbreaking exersice for my journey. In a way, it make me define from my own consciousness, what are my actual interests, and what moves me from my guts. In that case, i made a machine that makes music and its so simple that it can be played by everyone. So that shows my interest for making musical, technological and simple ways that improve peoples lives.

Also I will use that exercise with my students back in Chile, because to find something that interest us from very deep sometimes is very difficult, and with this tool, it can be much easier, it work different with every people but it was a very insight and successful exercise.

##### 2. 1PP Video

The 1 person perspective video also was a Second exersice that gave to me a lot of learnings from it. 
 Having the focus on only one task for a day is something that i think that i had not experience before, and it give to me a lot of insights.

 The improvisation in the exersice of design, opens a new creative way of doing things for me. My design process starts all the time with a pencil and a paper, seated in my desk triyng to figure things out. In this case I didn´t grab my pen, neither my notebook, just from the moment that I woke up, i started improvising by the normal daily activities. that released me from the "designer" point of view, to the 1PP and participant way of view. So i started doing thing in a very fluid and efficient way, moving from one activitie to another, almost like an artist in his/her attelier, just creating.

 At the end of the exersice, I realise that I had commited my objective, that was creating something physical, from music. So when I complete that, I ended the day.

##### 3. Scale Diagram

The scale diagram that mariana showed us in the weak signals lecture, its the next step from 1PP design, going forward from us in the center, to a global context. I had work with iniciatives that goes from local to global, but with this tool, I realized that the stages in the middle are very important, and that its almost mandatory to make all the steps to move in a bigger or in a down scale.

This level of analizing projects or different subjects, leads to a sistemic way understanding a project in its complete context. 

Also with the content of the recent lecture, we can add another axis to the graph. I have realized that time cannot be lef apart because it is crucial to understand what has happened before, to speculate what is going to happen in the different scales in upcoming futures.

Reflection 1st term

#### What

Investigation about how the intersection of fabrication, design, music and social impact, can lead to new projects in the emergent futures. Understanding the music as an energy that transform our physical world, and Design as a vehicle of  conscient and focused creation with specific people in a specific context.

#### Why?

I find in music, a mysterious way to get things done. Some people use it for sports, some other for relax, and some other just to enjoy. In my case, I play electric guitar, experimenting and exploring sound. Also i come from a family of Musicians, My grandfather was an orchestra director back in Chile, and also a cultural gestor, funding the juvenile orchestra foundation for kids with low resources. thats where i saw that music can change peoples lives.
The same kind of impact I noticed in design when I worked with young people with Epidermolysis Bullosa (Butterfly skin) developing products to improve their daily life. Noticing that involving in some others life, with simple, low tech and creative solutions,  can make a huge impact in their way of living.
So in this investigation, im crossing two things that I love, Music and the physical world of design. 

#### Now what

Now it’s time to summarize all the learnings and experiments that I have made in the first term and reflect about it.

It’s necessary to find and activate the community where the project can affect in a positive way or make a real impact.

At first im looking for musicians that are interested to collaborate with this in an experimental way. Also looking for places, clubs, foundations, etc, that gather this kind of people, and are interested in non traditional ways of showing a music spectacle.

Designers, Sonar artist of materialist, are some other people that I would like to connect with, Because it would be a great opportunity to collaborate and enrich the process.


#### Comparison with past actions

In first term, I made 7 experiments that relate low tech, music, energy, frequencies, fractals and materials. It was an interesting straight forward process, where I open the relation of music and fabrication. All of the experiments were made by me, in my studio. So for the second term I will aim to involve more people to this process, to hear opinions, look for comments, and co create something. Understanding that the music and creating experience is more rich, when it is collaborative.

#### what if questions

-What if I connect with musicians and artist in a local intervention?

-what if I use a self made piece of music to fabricate something.

-What if I look for this relation in urban spaces?

-What if I connect people to create this things in a distributed way(Online)

-What if I use AI or other systems to automatize the process of creation?

-What if I make a public design intervention, using using to materialize something?

-What If I work with people who don’t have nothing to do with music?



##### Design Intervention 2.0

OPEN JAM

The second version of the design intervention will be to enable people to create, record, and reproduce music easily, accesible, by creating a stand alone open source system without the need of a computer or any complex and expensive device or software.


**Communities:**

![](../images/DI2_01.png)

The community search is open wide to three main subjects, Music exploration, nature and tech projects, and audiovisual installations, where is a interaction between the musical work and people.

Related to people, I have found that I have a lot of musical connection with people in Barcelona, Some profesional musicians, and people that I had work with, in musical instruments.

Also I had added music spaces that will be able to collaborate to make a public intervention, near my house. In gracia, there is a place called, Soda acustic, where every thursday, they make an experimental music session, just before jams sessions.

Analyzing my music making devices.

![](../images/DI2_04.JPG)

I had made a quick tryout with one challenge, wich would be the easiest way to create/record music with more people. At first I had tried with an synth, the OP-1, that is a multitrack, self sufficient device for creating music.
It enables to record, sample, and modify each track like the old 4 tape recorders.
With the interaction of my classmates, I had noticed that is not that easy to encourage people to create music, if the instruments are made for one person use. Also that the process of playing with sound, sometimes can be even anoying if someone is working in a different thing, So maybe the classroom is not the best place to experiment with sound.



![](../images/DI2_03.JPG)
From left to right: 1.Boss Loop Station, 2. Zoom audio interface and recorder,3. Pocket operator rythm.

This devices are the simplest devices that I have to make and record a musical piece, with the loop. its possible to create a track in a specific amount of time that repeats everytime, and it allows to record or erase another track, just pushing the lid. With the recorder its posible to obtain any sound from the environment, to people looks very appealing to record their voices and play with loops. Finally with the PO, its possible to create rythms by just pushing those buttons.

This is a sample of a piece of music created with these three devices:


The cons of useing this kind of devices is that they run on battery, the are pretty expensive, and no one is open source, they use a lot of non recyclable parts, and they are closed hardware, So there is an opportunity to develop this kind of musical devices and re-thinking them to be used in different contexts.


**Opening Communities.**

I went to find a music space that is open to artist, so I found "Nocturna Discordia" in soda acoustic, a music bar in my neighborhood, Gracia.

Nocturna Discordia is an instance where experimental Music is welcome, they had opened that space since 2012, So its almost 10 years where there has been experimental music, artists, and creators.

I went to a concert to experience what nocturna discordia was about, And for my surprise, was actually very interesting and nice. They were a group of musicians that were improvising and they didn’t new between each other before, so the result was also very interesting. because was fully improvisational.

After the concert I talked to the vocalist, she was very nice and friendly, I told her was I was doing and she told me about new places like hangar.org or la escosesa, in Poble nou. 

Th other guy that I talked, was Andrés, he is the organizer of the event, and he was very interested and open to see what we were able to do there. I talked him about the plant b project, and we agreed that I have to send him some material, and set a date to play there.
For next steps I will go to hangar and la escosesa so see what we can do, or collaborate.

**Making a Looper machine with Chris**

We manage to build a DIY collaborative looper stations called OPENJAM BOX, using raspberry Pi and youtube tutorials to make it work.

Our goal was to build some musical project that would be easy to build and program, and we manage to find the tutorial for a multitrack looper. and we transformit into a looper that enable more people to create music together, so the initial design is meant to be used by four people, where they can record and play a track.

All info related to the looper is in

**Design intervention Planing**

Continuing to exploring my question about how music can change physical realities.

So the intervention consist to make an instance were people will modify clay figures related to the music that they are listening.

So this are the planned steps related to the intervention.

1.- Bring the clay and guitar(my instrument) to the class

2.- I will invite the classmates to sit in front of three or four clay balls, and I will guide them through to tell them that the can modify the pieces while listening to music, so each figure will represent a moment.

Also I will ask them to be "blind" to make the sense of listening better.

3.- It should be some classmate that would help me to record this intervention.

4.-I will record each track to use it later with the fogures.

5.-The results will be documented in pictures with collab and 3d scanning and printing.

6.- The final result will be a collaborative and meaningfull series of objects.


This process will be fully of improvistation, so I dont want to practice what I will play, or to tell them what to do, will be free.
