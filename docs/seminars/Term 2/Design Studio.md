#### Three learnings from the first term:

##### 1. The Magic machine. 

The magic machine exersice looking it from now, was a groundbreaking exersice for my journey. In a way, it make me define from my own consciousness, what are my actual interests, and what moves me from my guts. In that case, i made a machine that makes music and its so simple that it can be played by everyone. So that shows my interest for making musical, technological and simple ways that improve peoples lives.

Also I will use that exercise with my students back in Chile, because to find something that interest us from very deep sometimes is very difficult, and with this tool, it can be much easier, it work different with every people but it was a very insight and successful exercise.

##### 2. 1PP Video

The 1 person perspective video also was a Second exersice that gave to me a lot of learnings from it. 
 Having the focus on only one task for a day is something that i think that i had not experience before, and it give to me a lot of insights.

 The improvisation in the exersice of design, opens a new creative way of doing things for me. My design process starts all the time with a pencil and a paper, seated in my desk triyng to figure things out. In this case I didn´t grab my pen, neither my notebook, just from the moment that I woke up, i started improvising by the normal daily activities. that released me from the "designer" point of view, to the 1PP and participant way of view. So i started doing thing in a very fluid and efficient way, moving from one activitie to another, almost like an artist in his/her attelier, just creating.

 At the end of the exersice, I realise that I had commited my objective, that was creating something physical, from music. So when I complete that, I ended the day.

##### 3. Scale Diagram

The scale diagram that mariana showed us in the weak signals lecture, its the next step from 1PP design, going forward from us in the center, to a global context. I had work with iniciatives that goes from local to global, but with this tool, I realized that the stages in the middle are very important, and that its almost mandatory to make all the steps to move in a bigger or in a down scale.

This level of analizing projects or different subjects, leads to a sistemic way understanding a project in its complete context. 

Also with the content of the recent lecture, we can add another axis to the graph. I have realized that time cannot be lef apart because it is crucial to understand what has happened before, to speculate what is going to happen in the different scales in upcoming futures.
