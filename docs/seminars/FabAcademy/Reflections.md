#### Reflections

Week 1:

The Class of Neil Gershenfeld introducing the FabAcademy course, has nearly to 300 participants in zoom, its very interesting that a systems like this work all arround the world for a long time.

As MDEF students we are going to experience the FabAcademy in a hybrid way. having micro challenges and making reflections for each week.

Interesting things that Neil shows, are project management advices, principally is that they are going to use git, for document everything. also he shows mainly open source programs, and methods.

Also he gives the advice that it's better to document everytime, and get used to it.
