#### Week 2:

**3d printing in Clay**

The knowledge of the material is very important to print clay objects, we take a lot of time preparing the tubes with clay to have a proper extrusion, for the second iteration, we had put the clay with 10% of its weight with water, so it would be more consistent and homogeneus.

Another issue that has to be controlled is the extruder and the preasure, because for now, the process is trial and error all the time, also depending on the texture of the material, the preasure changes, so its a manual process that has to be standarized, if we want to take the 3d printing to another level.

For now, the paste printer is not as simple and easy than the regular filament printing, its interesting that the precise moment of printing is the shortest one in the whole process.(preparing the material, loading the file, printing, cleaning) its possible to build shapes, but it is a bit messy, so its necessary to have the whole process documented, and open to let more people improve that process.
