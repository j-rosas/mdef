#### Week 2:

**Computer asisted design**

As a designer, I had used a lot of softwares related to CAD, like rhino, Fusion, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. The interesting thing about this lectures is that the FabLab Team and Neil, showed us a lot of new Open Source softwares, where its possible to do the same(or more) taks that the other programs. I had never seen the open source software potential so clear till now.

**Blender.**

Blender is a free and open source 3d creation suite. and ist also free!. With this software, its possible to program, model, animate, simulate, render, etc. Its quite impressive how a collaborative open source program can reach such a high level as blender. In the seminar Victor also showed us some examples of projects created with blender.
