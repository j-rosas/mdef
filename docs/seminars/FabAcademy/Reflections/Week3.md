#### Week 2:

**Parametric Design**

Its very gratifiying to face a challenge with not that certainity of the result, At first I was trying to build a module with a curved and specific shape, but the process of working with grasshoper (that was quite difficult) made me think about the shape of the final result, simplyfing it a lot and making it possible to finish the file. Also its the first time that I start a grasshopper file from scratch, so is also good that im possible to make that.

**LaserCut**

Related to the lasercut, For the next time i will think about the leftovers of the lasercut, because its actually possible to use them tyo have almost no residues, in this case I dintd thought of that so the inner pieces had the pottencial to be used in the project. Also I would like to make the product in other materials rather than acrilyc.
