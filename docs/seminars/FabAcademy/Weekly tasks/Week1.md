##### Challenge 2

Doc 1:

The documentation of Alejandra Tothill is very interesting, At first its a bit complicated because is non traditional graphics, but when you understand it, it gets easier and funny to navigate by. Also the use of diferent fonts, makes the 80’s aesthetics nice to watch.

Doc 2:

Clement rames, His documentation is very simple, for me its better to go simple because its more efficient for the reader and easy to watch and navigate.

Doc 3:

Paco’s Documentation is nice as well, because he adds a lot of pictures and sketches/drawings, or videos. Also he keeps the info very simple and friendly to read.
