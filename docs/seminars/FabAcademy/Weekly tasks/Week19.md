3d Printing


3d Printing

For this Asignment, we gather togueter with Angel Jo, to try to print in Clay with the hacked 3D ender 3 printer.

The first try was a bit difficult, because the material was a bit hard, so we manage to mix it with more water, to make it enter into the extruder with less preasure.

The G-code was quite simple, just a cilinder to make the printing easy, and to understand the material paramenters, and the complexity that was to print clay for the first time.

Finally, as the piece was printing quite weak, in the top layers, it started to collapse to the inside of the cilinder.

The challenge now is to control the matter, the process and the machine, to mantain a certain order to fabricate more pieces.
