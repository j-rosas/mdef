##### Week 3

Laser cutting 


Week 3 - Computer-controlled cuttingÂ¶

Create a small object using parametric design tools. The object should be assembled in a press-fit way (no use of glue, screws etc).

Complete the Machine test with the 100% of the score-CHECK

Parametric design

For this assignment, I challenge myself to use Grasshopper to design the object, in this case, I made a module like a lego, where the main piece is parametric, its possible to define the thickness of the material, the size, the amount of legs that the ensemble has, etc. It was quite a challenge but I manage to design the grasshopper file, its a bit raw but the result works for this exersize.
