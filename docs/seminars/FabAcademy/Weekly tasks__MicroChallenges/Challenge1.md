#### Micro Challenge 1



Prototiping a 4 track collaborative loop station.

We manage to design and build a 4track looper that can be used by more than one person, wich loopers are designed to.

We used Raspberry Pi to program the functionionality, and some electronic components distributed in a way that is thinked to be played by four people. with 1/4 jack inputs and microphones.

We started with some sketches and cardboard prototypes, for making an idea of the look and feel of the prototype.

As we knew that the electronics setup will be constant, the idea is to build this first prototype accesible from top.

As we wanted to use acrilyc, we did some quick test in lasercut for have tight and a bit loose joints.

The 3d model was designed in fusion 360,
