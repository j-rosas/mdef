**Documenting**

Doc 1:

The documentation of Alejandra Tothill is very interesting, At first its a bit complicated because is non traditional graphics, but when you understand it, it gets easier and funny to navigate by. Also the use of diferent fonts, makes the 80â€™s aesthetics nice to watch.

Doc 3:

Rogers guilemany website is quite interesting, because he uses a lot of text at the beginning, quite unusual for a website. Also the two column grid, gives another layer of interest for the website.
