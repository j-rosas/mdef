Molding and CastingÂ¶

Make a mold (can be 1 or two sides) HARD-SOFT-HARD . 3DPRINT- CAST SILICONE- CAST SOMETHING INSIDE
You can use biomaterials to substitute the silicone or the final cast.
Experiment!


For this task, the objective was to create a bioplastic button, that will be on top of some 3d printing objects that have buttons and sensors to trigger some values. The shape of the mold is a semicircle and has two wholes to pass the bolts throug and fix the Biomaterial. The mold was 3d printed and it took like two hours to print.

Biomaterial Recipe:

Agar Agar :4g

Water: 80 ml

Glycerin: 15 ml

Process: Mix everything togueter while its cold, then pour the mix on a glass, and heat it in a microwave for 1.30 min.

After 10 minutes, the material is cold and aglomerated like gelatin, it is possible to take it out the mould and install it on the controllers.

One of the good things of using molds its that it ensures replicability, so in a shor time we manage to have two controllers working with sensors and buttons. One of the cons of bioplastic is that it has to loose the water, so it shrinks like half of its size, but for this purpose, we will cook the materials  the day before, or just print a bigger mold.
