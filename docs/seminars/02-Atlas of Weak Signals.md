### Week 2

# ATLAS OF WEAK SIGNALS

### Initial Design Space

### Second assignment.

1. **Screenshots of your individual design space**
    1. Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago?

    How to grow almost anything thrills me to encourage the future of fabrication in a very interesting way. Looking how nature build its all structures and different kind of things, It is a bit difficult to relate to my fight that looks more with a social aproach, but I think one of the oportunities is to find the link betweeen this areas.
    

**STATE OF THE ART**

**THINGS THAT I HAD GROWN**

**A BETTER FUTURE**

**MY ACTUAL INTEREST**

Also Im very interested in this specific subjects:

-Biofabrication
-Metamaterials
-Self assembly objects
-Bio sensors
-Low energy objects.
-Ai/ Machine learning

2. **Multi scalar diagram**

My multiscalar diagram, is mainly my questions that appeared by thinking the opportunity of working with nature in very different ways, After, I arranged it into different scales to be new starting points from the scale that the questions are.


### 2. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales.

The Atlas of weak signals is a very interesting tool that helps to connect subjects and extreme postures, aslo appearing a lot of new subjects that surprised me because I had never heard about them, so is interesting as well to see the diversity of areas that we can investigate and work. Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities.


### 3. **Screenshots of your collaborative design space**

### 1. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others?
    
### 1. Someone you would like to contact

For this investigation I will contact a lot of people from different networks, and places:

**Chile:**
Bruno Grossi-Biologist Phd in Biomimetics
Biolab UC- Work and reaserch in biomaterials
Carolina Pacheco- Works in Cal.careo, growing things and structures in calcium carbonate.
Nicolas Viollier- MDEF Alumni, works with mycelium and regenerative design.


**Spain**

-Iaac MDEF alumni that had worked with biofabricaction projects
The poble now urban place that makes workshops and urban gardens.


 2. An experiment you’d like to make**

**Some inicial experiments that I want to make:**

Grow something functional, simple and usefull things.(a cristal salted ring.)

Replace a functional object using only natural resources.(see under water with your own hands)

Use nature energy to do something else.(carnivor plants as an imput.)



### 3. A new skill you’d like to add to your personal development plan

 A skill that i want to improve more is to be a maker, a lot more hands on that today, from overthinking and having a lot of prejudices, to doing and fabricating a lot more.

 Also I want to learn and use technology in a friendly way, not struggling a lot with programming and electronics, but understanding as a common tool to be used in new projects.
