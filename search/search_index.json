I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program.

Screenshots of your individual design space Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? How to grow almost anything thrills me to encourage the future of fabrication in a very interesting way. Looking how nature build its all structures and different kind of things, It is a bit difficult to relate to my fight that looks more with a social aproach, but I think one of the oportunities is to find the link betweeen this areas. STATE OF THE ART THINGS THAT I HAD GROWN A BETTER FUTURE MY ACTUAL INTEREST Also Im very interested in this specific subjects: -Biofabrication -Metamaterials -Self assembly objects -Bio sensors -Low energy objects. -Ai/ Machine learning Multi scalar diagram My multiscalar diagram, is mainly my questions that appeared by thinking the opportunity of working with nature in very different ways, After, I arranged it into different scales to be new starting points from the scale that the questions are. 2. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. The Atlas of weak signals is a very interesting tool that helps to connect subjects and extreme postures, aslo appearing a lot of new subjects that surprised me because I had never heard about them, so is interesting as well to see the diversity of areas that we can investigate and work. Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities. Screenshots of your collaborative design space How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? Next steps - Based on the work this week please tell me: Someone you would like to contact For this investigation I will contact a lot of people from different networks, and places: Chile: Bruno Grossi-Biologist Phd in Biomimetics Biolab UC- Work and reaserch in biomaterials Carolina Pacheco- Works in Cal.careo, growing things and structures in calcium carbonate. Nicolas Viollier- MDEF Alumni, works with mycelium and regenerative design. Spain -Iaac MDEF alumni that had worked with biofabricaction projects The poble now urban place that makes workshops and urban gardens. An experiment you\u2019d like to make** Some inicial experiments that I want to make: Grow something functional, simple and usefull things.(a cristal salted ring.) Replace a functional object using only natural resources.(see under water with your own hands) Use nature energy to do something else.(carnivor plants as an imput.) 3. A new skill you\u2019d like to add to your personal development plan A skill that i want to improve more is to be a maker, a lot more hands on that today, from overthinking and having a lot of prejudices, to doing and fabricating a lot more.","title":"ATLAS OF WEAK SIGNALS"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"DESIGN SPACE Second assignment.
