The dark spots are different kind of fungus that had appeared on the Agar Agar base. \u00b6 We learn also how to work in a sterile invironment, using fire as a \u201csafe\u201d for inoculating bacteria into the petri dish. \u00b6 Spirulina Microscopes PCR Scientific method and tools Week 4 \u00b6 Analisis and comparison of Soils Analise ph levels Cook biomaterials Get escential Oils from laurel Analize plants with iNaturalist \u00bfScientific Paper: Robotically Controlled Fiber-based Manufacturing as Case Study for Biomimetic Digital Fabrication \u00b6 N. Oxman, M. Kayser, J. Laucks and M. Firstenberg Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Neri Oxman job has allways impressed me, the first time I saw the silk pavilion, I was amazed about the concept about collaborating with nature instead of make nature work for humans. The sinergy beetween technology, digital fabrication and technological systems is very well designed. \u00b6 the process of obtainnig the silk, has been for hundreds of years a process againts nature, because normally the cocoons of silk are boiled to separate the silk, killing the worms, growed in farms and in a non organic way. The interesting thing about this new process, Is that they propose a new way to extract sik without killing the worms, by letting them to wove their cocoons, and at the same time, evolve into the next stage of the larva. \u00b6 I picked this paper to understand in an specific way, how this ingestigation started, how the probes were made, to understand how is possible to work with this organic systems and to create new ways of manufacture. \u00b6 Sumary 3d printing vs natural fabrication \u00b6 3D printing traditional methods, are very funtional in a way, but it is not as efficient as natural fabrication, like spider webs, birds nests, or worm silk, wich contruction is organic and high efficient, ussing the less resource ass posible, working in an incredible way, so that statement opens a new investigation direction, where the natural procesess inspired humands, to develop new methods of manufacture. \u00b6 Fiber orientation \u00b6 \u201cUsing additive manu- facturing technologies are much less sustainable: from a material perspective - homogeneous materi- als offer less potential for structural optimization; and from a fabrication perspective - additive manu- factured components are constructed in layers, rely- ing on the deposition of significant amounts of wasted support material\u201d \u00b6 The fiber construction method is very effective, because it uses a high resistant material, to the purpose of protecting the cocoon, till it reaches its evolving stage, the puppa. One cocoon has more than a kilometer long, and its deposited in the most efficient way. \u00b6 About silk \u00b6 Silk is an amazing material, its one of the most high ended, exensive and old materials recolected by humans, its used to make clothes, fibers, and its used in textile industry and medicine. The silk as a material also has a binder, the cericin.The worm makes the cocoon using its own environment attaching the silk into different points. \u00b6 Motion tracking \u00b6 In the reaserch, they installed a worm into a acrilic box, and they used different of cameras to analyse how many points of contact were used by the worm to make the sik structure, concluding that they were more than 1.000.000 points of contact. that motion track, encouraged the team to speculate about a robotic process of fabrication. \u00b6 Fiber based robot simulating construction \u00b6 Using a Kuka robot, they manage to install a headset to the robotic arm, that deposit HDPE, a termoplastic that can be used for 3d printing. Also they conclude that changing the extrude power and speed of the headset, would be possible to vary in density, thikness and quality of the material. Also they simulated the contact points with hook on the wall, enabling the robotig arm to create HDPE structures based on the silk worm funtion. \u00b6 Images: Making a mutant The drought has been a issue from long time ago, but now we can see its impact in a lot of scenes. In Chile, The desertification its happening rigth know, and its effects are vissible to the eye. \u201cAculeo\u201d lagoon was a balneary 30 min far from Santiago, where families have houses arround the lake, and ussually go for the weekend to swim and make watersports. Today that lagoon is a desert field of dry land, where horses and cows eat grass. \u00b6 There are some local inventions to battle the drought, One is called \u201cfresh water\u201d. Its a home machine that literaly takes water from the air and transform it to drinkable water. That process is very interesting, and it has been used for little comunities that have no acces to potable water. \u00b6 This kind pf project are very nice inventions, but to make that proceses, they use a lot of energy, electricity, and resources to be constructed. Other iniciatives, are the recollectors of morning humidity in the coast, called \u201ccamanchaca\u201d. They are inspired in plants or grass, that recollect the morning fog\u00b4s water to hidratate the plant or soil. Its the same Idea, but with a horizontal net that gathers drops of water to acumulate it to pipes or more bigger water containers, so we are literally getting water from humidity. \u00b6 My idea of gene mutation is inspired by human made water recolection systems, and some nature systems, like the Namib desert beetle, that use its legs to recollect or harvest water from the fog in the air. \u00b6 There is an impressive reptile, that has the possibillity to control its temperature form external factors. The Leatherback turte. \u00b6 \u201cLeatherback sea turtles are so successful at regulating their body temperature that they have the ability to maintain constant body temperature 18 degrees above or below the ambient temperature. That is so incredible that some researchers argue because this process is metabolically accomplished leatherback sea turtles are actually endothermic. However, this process is not anatomically conducted, therefore most researchers suggest this is a diminutive version of endothermy at best.\u201d \u00b6 Would be possible to modificate humans genes, to give the biological cappacity to obtain and hydratate with the water from the environment? \u00b6 Looking to igem.org tools and projects, I havent found anything like this kind pfo project, As we talked in class, CrispCas-9 should be a possible way to edit or modify human DNA, specifically the generation of cells that help us regulate our inner temperature system. \u00b6 https://www.science.org/content/article/could-desert-beetle-help-humans-harvest-water-thin-air https://oceanadventures.co.za/animals-regulate-body-temperature/ https://oceanfdn.org/the-thermoregulating-ectotherm/ Reflection This set of lectures, were very interesting and inspiring because from the biology point of view, my interest in grow almost anything, has to do a lot. Also for me, is necesarry to know the basics of biology, if im going to work with biofabrication, biomaterials and living organisms. I also would be using a lot my toolbox network, to contact profesionals if I have more doubts about biology. \u00b6 The only comment that I would do to Nuria is that in some parts, the concepts were too \u201cscientific\u201d, so I get lost sometimes in the terminology, but with a bit of asking and time, I was able to understand the main concepts. \u00b6 Also all the practical area in both Bio / Agri, were very insightfull, because we were able to see how a lot of things work, like how to grow bacterias, or how to work in a sterile environment. That are totally usefull things that I will be useing for shure along the master. \u00b6 For de Agri Zero week, I found that im much more interested and related to the conuntryside that I was aware. All my youth I used to lived in the countryside of Curic\u00f3, a city in the middle south of Chile, famous for its Vineyards and fields for agriculture. Also my both parents are agronomists, so I had been related to the field mostly all my life. I find very interesting to use Barcelona as a natural laboratory. we have a big opportunity to work with nature here, and take advantage of Valldaura labs as well, if we need some countryside help or inspiration \u00b6","title":"Biology Agri Zero"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#week-3-4","text":"","title":"Week 3-4"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#bio_agri_zero","text":"Teachers: Jonathan Minchin Nuria Conde Grow your own Bacteria","title":"BIO_AGRI_ZERO"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#for-this-activity-we-manage-to-grow-a-bacteria-from-residues-in-iaacs-environment-for-the-sample-i-took-pidgeon-poop-that-was-outside-iaac-at-the-bicycle-parking-the-dark-spots-are-different-kind-of-fungus-that-had-appeared-on-the-agar-agar-base","text":"","title":"For this activity we manage to grow a bacteria from residues in iaacs environment, for the sample, I took pidgeon poop, that was outside Iaac, at the bicycle parking.

I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. \u00b6 The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. \u00b6 In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. \u00b6 Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: \u00b6 -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. \u00b6 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future \u00b6 My poster reflects how the future should be, in my perspective, there has to be people \u201cjoining the dots\u201d, unifying the creative aspects and profesions, with citizens and people, as Victor Papanek said, Design can be a very well use tool, or the most dangerous carreer of all. The main thing is that design can change realities, points of view, and the most important, can improve peoples lifes. \u00b6 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. \u00b6 My Identity is very powerfull as a designer itself, from a long time ago, I started designing even before start going to Design school, Almost every Sunday, I tried to create something interesting and usefull. My skills are maily from building things, related to design, crafts and arts, to beaing an easy learner in some aspects, I have to recognize that electronics and programming are a bit difficult for me to learn. \u00b6 Related to my attitude, I feel like a very positive person, allways trying to go for the bright side, aalso trying to be a fresh person, related to people, and new knowledge that is arround. Also Im very Open and confident about the things that I do, and im very bad to say No to challenges. \u00b6 My knowledge goes mainly in creative ways, like design, arts, materials, methodologies, etc. I find myself like a \u201d sea of 1mm of depth\u201d because I love to learn and do a lot but mainly with no depth in everything \u00b6 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude \u00b6 With the meetings I had found that I had been atracted to lear programming and coding as some classmates, but it allways goes to nothing, because I don\u00b4t keep practising it, and when I had the chance, in FabLab U. de Chile, I had been \u201csafe\u201d in my own knowledge and tasks. So thats a very interesting challenge for me. \u00b6 Also im beginning to interest in new subjects, as AI, VR, and Biology. 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity \u00b6 My new professional Identity, would be like an digital fabrication designer + Technological tools, like programming and the use of electronics in projects. I would love to learn more about it in \u201cTech beyond myth\u201d \u00b6 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). \u00b6 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program. \u00b6 I had made a circular draft for the first term, because I think that the 1st term process is circular, not returning to zero, but to gain the experience of the courses and become a \u201cnew me\u201d with all the new knowledge and experiences. \u00b6 Week 1 Asignature :MDEF Bootcamp Skills :Use of workshop tools, get use to iaac space, Learn git, and web programming Knowledge : design theory, new concepts of design, new learning process, working adaptation.

I had created a new workspace based on my new investigation subject, I started with the subject \u201d How to grow almost anything\u201d, but its interesting how the subject starts to grow itself. \u00b6 My new workspace have new areas, like an instagram page, where im collecting all of the \u201cgrowed\u201d things that I find dalyly, like parrots nest on a light tower, or furballs made by peoples hair in transtation, thats a very nice activity to do because it feeds the workspace almost everyday with things that I see everyday. \u00b6 Also I had added a \u201cfield notes\u201d part, because I like to write notes of everything that I see, classes, talks, conversations, Ideas. Its comfortable to have that Pages visually in the design space, also is material to share with my classmates. \u00b6 Im adding as well state of the art projects, to see what can I learn from them, and what its missing in that state, Would be great to found some new ways in the field. \u00b6 I had notice that my studio relates to two main fields, materials and energy, so I will focus my project In that direction. I will make profund observation of this subjects in the process of the master. \u00b6 2. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in (onion mapping from the Atlas) and add them to your design space. My way of prototiping, at the moment has been near to different Roles, at first I thought that my process was accumulative, going deeper into the \u201cgrow\u201d subject, but I have realised that the concept is more abstract, that only grow biological things, so It has been a mix of comparative, and probing as well. \u00b6 3. Do your first design experiment applying one or different roles of prototyping. Experiments: Details of the experiments are in the \u201cProject\u201d tab. Grow Materials to generate something Usefull. The first experiment starts from the question of \u201cCan I add value to some existing object, growing something into it? \u00b6 The first experiment was to grow salt cristals in an earing, showing in a simple way, that a growed system can add value to a simple object as an earing. Also in terms of time, jewellery is very acord because the salt don\u00b4t need that much time to grow in it. \u00b6 2)Make an action that normally you will use an object to acomplish, with the minimum resources. I had saw that technique in youtube, to see underwater only with my hands, I do it all the time when I dont have my snorkelling googles. This experiment has amazed me because the concept of useing nothing but your body to make a task, is something that we don\u00b4t question that much in our normal lifes, we allways think that we need \u201csomething\u201d to archieve our goals, for example if we teach our children to do this technique, we are avoiding buying that cheap snorkeling googles that are selled on the beach, used once and thtown away, because they were broken, bad quality, or the kid wasnt interested anymore. \u00b6 3)Using natures energy to create something The third one aims to use the mechanical energy of living organisms to enable them to comunicate with humans when they move.(output) \u00b6 For this project I had used the energy of the Carnivore plant, so when it picked a bug or a fly, it will move and let me know when it catches something. For the experiment I had attached to aluminum foil, because of the weight, to each leaf of the plant, and the foil were connected to an arduino with the Led program, so the foils were the \u201ccircuit cut\u201d, and when they get togheter, they turn the Led On. This project made me wonder a lot of questions, for example how would be to work with nature, and not nature work for you, also the moving \u201cenergy\u201d of the plant is a very interesting way to keep investigating natural and not conventional uses of energy.. \u00b6 New Toolbox Position ourselves in the Design space and make a reflection. Week 5 A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work At the moment, The documentation process, has been a constant auto learning process, as we use the design space, github, and web platforms, Its neccesary to make a \u201croutine\u201d to make the documenting, more efficient. \u00b6 Allways my documentation process starts from writing and drawing on my notebook, because Its faster, and more memorable for me. \u00b6 My second tool is my cellphone, for pictures, video and audio recording, makes easier to gather info, to make gifs or photo edition. \u00b6 With the phone, One app is Instagram, I have made an instagram called Grow your things lab, where I upload and share daily Discoveries or observations on the \u201cgrow\u201d concept. \u00b6 Another app that I use a lot is \u201cArduino Science Journal\u201d, Is very good because its possible to use the sensors of the phone to make experiments, also works like a science journal to take pictures and write on them. \u00b6 Then the final step is uploading everything to github webpage and miro design space. The good thing of git, is that anybody can enter and take anything from the webpage. \u00b6 3 min Video aprox wich can include multiple ways of video journaling documenting the course tech beyond myth. (EXPERIMENT!!) Week 9 Documenting Tech beyond myth \u00b6 The goal of the documentation was to record audios from the teachers in their lectures, gathering the most interesting words and phrases, and manage to put them all in a certain order to make a beat from the better parts of the course. \u00b6 The second part was to gather one word from each classmate to get what they got from the course, from learnings to feelings. \u00b6 The hardwarte used was a OP-1 Sintetizer, a zoom recorder, iphone for audios. \u00b6 The software used was logic pro, illustrator, and imovie. \u00b6 A reflection that i had is that the mic recorder is a very complementary tool for lectures because if its used properly, it is very low sized in memory, and its very accesible and hearable, like a podcast or something similar. I have a good auditive memory, so this tool complements very well with the sketchbook where I write and draw all the time. \u00b6 TERM 2 \u00b6 Three learnings from the first term: The Magic machine. 1PP Video Scale Diagram","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Design%20Studio/#week-11","text":"","title":"Week 11"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"Teachers: Oscar Tomico Tom\u00e1s Vivanco 1.

An Exploration of Inter-Species Collaboration For the final Design Dialogues event at the end of term 1, Joaquin, Didac and Chris teamed up for the accompanying design intervention. We are interested in the intersection between music, collaborative jamming, nature and how these things can be combined. We wanted to research how engaging in an intimate collaborative setting with plants could foster a meaningful inter-species connections. For that, we decided to enable a inter-species jam session, where the plants would be both musicians and instruments. Below, our conceptual ideas and project planning can be found, as well as some first sketches for the final project artifact. \u00b6 Building a Prototype With the help of the MakeyMakey, some plants from the Fab Lab office (thank you!) and Ableton Live, we managed to get a first minimal viable product for a few classmates to test out. See some of the impressions below: \u00b6 First Insights We managed to extract some interesting insights from these experiments. First of all, it was intriguing to see how the sounds produced did not only dramatically change the perception of the users towards this plant, but also the interaction that comes with it. From slight touching and caressing to pinching and hitting the plant, a wide range of interactions could be observed just by linking different sounds to the individual plants. Secondly, the perception of the experiment as a whole changed according to what musical mood we were aiming for: There proved to be a much different vibe between mysterious, atmospheric synthesizer and bell chimes samples on the one hand and some pulsing electronic lead synths on the other hand \u2013 while one made our test users connect to the plant on a emotional level, the driving electronic rhythms resonated with our test subjects on a more physical level. This first experiment clearly illustrates why sample selection is an incredibly integral part of the intervention, because it profoundly shapes both interaction with and perception of the plants. \u00b6 Preparation For the preparation of the intervention we split the work between the tree of us, each taking charge of a different component of the final product. That meant figuring out the electronics, designing and building the plant boxes and doing the sound design for the plants. Below, you can find some images documenting our progress towards the final result. \u00b6 The Intervention On the day of our intervention, which was Sunday, 12 Dec, we were blessed with a beautiful weather and a calm Sunday noon vibe in Parc de la Cuitadella, where a lot of families went for a walk. Already while setting up, people stopped and asked to interact with the plants. We\u2019ll let the images below speak for themselves. \u00b6 Reflections on the Intervention The response to our intervention was overwhelming and for all of us everything but anticipated. As it can be seen in the pictures and the video above, we were fortunate to witness some very special moments of intimate interactions between passersby and plants to make music together. Especially children were absolutely enchanted by the concept of singing plants and were the most fearless when it came to interacting with the plants. Often, adults would be shy at first \u2013 but after inviting them in to join, they usually lost their initial hesitancy. Throughout all ages and genders, people were amazed by this way of interacting with plants, which was new for almost all of them. \u00b6 People touched the plants softly, with respect, caressing them to test out the different sounds. Quickly, people understood the basic logic of the setup and how a circuit was closed to trigger the sounds. From there, it often took just a single comment about the conductivity of the human skin in order to start people holding hands while making music. By doing that, they were able to multiply the amount of touch points with the plants and through that, were able to create much more complex soundscapes. These were the moments when we were sure to have enabled a rare moment of collaboration, not just between people but between two species. \u00b6 The sounds the plants made were not fixed \u2013 rather, they were changing constantly as we were trying to evolve the music piece that was collectively composed: Changing from major to minor scales, modulating tempo, drum patterns and chords as well as giving people more percussive or atmospheric sounds to play with. This influenced the interactions with the plants in a very profound way, since the sound each plant made was somehow understood as its \u2018voice\u2019, thus shaping the perception of its character. Through experimentation and iteration with the sounds, we began to understand what worked best in the context of this public performance. A looped drum pattern was integral to giving the collective jam session a rhythmic backbone and was necessary in order to draw people in to interact. On top of that, atmospheric and layered sounds in harmonic chords and re-triggering patterns proved to be among the most accessible samples to make music with in this particular setup, with this particular crowd of participants. Further inquiry into the sound design is needed. \u00b6 Many people asked about our social media profiles and/or personal contact details, which underlined the need for a good online presence (beyond this website) as well as the potential for professionalizing this intervention as a live performance. We declined any money offered to us by the intervention participants. \u00b6 Reflecting on the intervention with some distance, our most important goal was achieved, which was placing plants front and center in the interactions. In our experiment they were the integral part, to which the other components, music and technology, connected. This sparked many interesting conversations, which revolved around connecting to plants, how plants perceive touch, how plants react to the music we play and how plants feel in a profound way. Using music as a vehicle for creating empathy for other organisms to inspire inter-species collaboration proves to be a promising idea. \u00b6 Future Possibilities As far as the next steps of this project are concerned, there is a lot more to discover. The most immediate impulse was, of course, to frame this more as a curated live performance, which can be played in a music venue or club. This also begs for exploring the potentials of an integrated A/V show including generatively produced visuals accompanying the performance. This should be feasible and fairly easy to implement through connecting Ableton with Notch or Touchdesigner (thank you for pointing that out Tatjana!). \u00b6 The other interesting conceptual avenue to go down would be, instead of bringing plants to the city in artificial and highly curated environments, to bring the people to the nature to be embedded in the environment the plants originate from. This would enable us to facilitate more spontaneous and less curated interactions with the plants that are found there, to use music to improvise and to meditate with the ecosystem there. Conceptually, this is a very interesting approach to take with this experiment, which is to be regarded the polar opposite of the curated live show described in the paragraph above. \u00b6 All the information of our design intervention, observations and reflections, are in this link: https://plant-b.io","title":"Design intervention"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Design%20intervention/#week-11","text":"PLANT B PLANT B INTERVENTION from D\u00eddac Torrent on Vimeo .

First of all, it was intriguing to see how the sounds produced did not only dramatically change the perception of the users towards this plant, but also the interaction that comes with it. From slight touching and caressing to pinching and hitting the plant, a wide range of interactions could be observed just by linking different sounds to the individual plants. Secondly, the perception of the experiment as a whole changed according to what musical mood we were aiming for: There proved to be a much different vibe between mysterious, atmospheric synthesizer and bell chimes samples on the one hand and some pulsing electronic lead synths on the other hand \u2013 while one made our test users connect to the plant on a emotional level, the driving electronic rhythms resonated with our test subjects on a more physical level.

This influenced the interactions with the plants in a very profound way, since the sound each plant made was somehow understood as its 'voice', thus shaping the perception of its character. Through experimentation and iteration with the sounds, we began to understand what worked best in the context of this public performance. A looped drum pattern was integral to giving the collective jam session a rhythmic backbone and was necessary in order to draw people in to interact.

For example Didacs machine, the one with the brick at the bottom, was to show in a methaphorical way, when justice is reached, it a good chance to new ideas or oportunities, so it will turn on a light, when the balance is reached. \u00b6 Another observation that we made as a group was that at the same time, we aim to things that are right, or things that make possitive ways to funtion and for others, rather than random ideas. \u00b6 One thing that i learned is how the materiality of objects, can lead to different interpretations of reality and can make people to connect with very deep and abstract ideas, making this exersice a great vehicle for creativity and connection with our selfs, and our thoughts and emotions in the context that we are or in a context that we want to be. \u00b6 THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE / 1PP \u00b6 Concepts: \u00b6 -Auto ethnography -Radical thinking -Change yourself -Extreme situations -Design Intervention https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDu9yRFaVko I started with the Question, Can be the Music a potential \u201cenergy\u201d to materialize something? \u00b6 Recomendation from teachers: Keep it close, do a lot of experiments, \u201csee what happens\u201d, the restriction: Had to be music made by me, not others. \u00b6 From the magical machines exersice, I had realized that I allways persue music as a creative way to build something, as a non profesional musician, Im allways trying to mix music with my projects. So in this case, I started doing a musical breakfast, so I recorded every step of making a normal breakfast and then I manage to edit it in different ways in Logic pro,A music composer software. At first I joined all the sounds to sound at the same time, then I arranged it in a random order to see what would happen, then I ordered the sounds in a logical way to make them more pleasant to the ear. the result was very tipical so I moved forward. then I took the shaving machine, and started to shave myself in a musical rythm, then I realized that the hairs of my face, were like little dots in a pentagram, so I manage to order those hairs in a musical pentagram, and that action lead me to pick my guitar and play somethig inspired from that action. When I reached my guitar I htried different ways the musical amp make noise and energy, I realized that the bass notes were powerfull and moved more air compared to the treble, so I realized that I can puth thing to see that movenment of the speaker. then I moved forward adding a white paper and different types of dust, to see how it would change with different bass notes. Finally I manage to solidify the dust with some glue, at the same time that the speaker was moving, so I had created a unique shape mixing the material and the energy, with that result, I had answered my question, with a very promisin direction. \u00b6 via GIPHY A guide to successfull Auto Ethnography \u00b6 Define Study Boundaries: \u00b6 My limits were determined principaly by the question I made, It was the starting point, but open to changes, The main thing was the direction, that was to materialize something with/by music. Maybe some boundarie was the time (a day) and the place, because I determine that the place should be my work/music room, using thingsthat I allready had in that specific time and place. \u00b6 Authenticity: \u00b6 At first, when I begun the experiment, It felt not that authentic, because I had seen a lot of this before, on social network, or youtube. The next step was way more authentic(musical shaving) because my brain allready was on a mood of doing something different, and different conection with things that normally wouldnt be connected on this subject, for example grabbing my facial hair and pur it on a music pentagram, to make \u201cmusic notes\u201d, and that was very inspiring for grabing an instrument and start creating music. \u00b6 Plausibility \u00b6 It relates with my personal interests ( Music and fabrication) and how I made them to work toghether. Also I think that I can add more value, exploring creativity from these areas and join points that I had never thinked before, like music and fabrication. \u00b6 Criticality \u00b6 This projects gathers very technical and abstract concepts. The 1PP exersice put me on a very different starting point, from beng too methodogical, to start creating from a very fast and plastic state of mind, The mindset from the initial question, kept me motivated to make things different than usual. \u00b6 Self reavealing comunication. (honesty) \u00b6 My project was made under a stream of consciousnes, so I think that was also very honest made. Using no filters to each activity. The thing that I missed, was to show my emotions and thoughts in the video, because in every discovery, I was a very exited, where I knew that the emotions had a lot to give. Maybe the documentation is sometimes an obstacle to work freely. \u00b6 Ethnographic material with confesional content. \u00b6 For this experiment, I made very personal actions, like playing guitar in my house. The video itself was not that confetional, because the actions were guided through a secuencial time. Maybe the most personal thing is that the subjects that I worked, are very related to my passions. \u00b6 Generalizability \u00b6 The Idea of manufacture with music, can be very interesting for other musicians, designers, scientist, sound engeneers, etc. It is in a very initial stage, but it can be extrapolated into a different area and context, to give and involve more meaning for others. \u00b6 I totally would use these exersise in the future, for different tasks. \u00b6 What happen when I envolved myself / as an instrument? \u00b6 I enyoed this process in a very insightfull way, it was like entering in a totally diferent state of mind with no stops, also with a lot of emotions happening at the same time. I felt also that this exersise was the push that I needed to start a project from a totally different aproach, from this vulnerable position from myself. \u00b6 Did anything change about the way of working? \u00b6 It was kind of revealing to work in this way, It allowed me to move faster into the challenges in a much more creative way and with less constrains, Also it makes the process very enjoyable, personal and intense. \u00b6 Coments about my colective videos \u00b6 I feel very inspired by the work of my collective, at first it was difficult to find similarities, but after analizing and speaking with my classmates, we find that the concepts behind each video, had a lot of crossing concepts viewed from different perspcetives, but with the same goal, or the same intention. \u00b6","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#week-5","text":"","title":"Week 5"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Teachers: Kristina Anderson Oscar Tomico Angela Mackey","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#myself-drawing-in-a-minute","text":"","title":"Myself Drawing in a minute:"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#i-picture-myself-as-a-very-big-guy-with-a-pencil-in-a-hand-and-a-guitar-for-making-music-also-with-open-arms-reminding-me-that-i-have-to-be-open-to-new-ideas-also-in-a-forest-because-i-allways-like-to-be-arround-nature","text":"","title":"I picture myself as a very big guy with a pencil in a hand, and a guitar for making music, also with open arms reminding me that I have to be open to new ideas, also in a forest, because i allways like to be arround nature."},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#my-magic-machine","text":"","title":"My Magic machine:"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#the-instrument-of-random-music-is-a-magic-machine-that-plays-with-creativity-creating-music-when-the-metalic-pencil-hits-the-glass-bottle-in-a-random-way-as-talking-with-people-would-be-great-that-there-were-more-pencils-to-enable-the-instrument-to-be-colaborative-and-be-used-by-more-peole-instead-as-only-one","text":"","title":"The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one."},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#also-the-machine-is-kind-of-a-mask-in-a-way-because-it-shows-the-desire-of-creativity-and-joy-but-not-in-a-total-transparent-way-so-also-would-be-great-if-the-machine-could-be-more-transparent-showing-not-only-what-i-want-to-show-the-world-who-i-ambut-the-whole-spectrum-of-personality-and-that-should-be-great-to-show-in-its-functionality","text":"","title":"Also the machine is kind of a mask in a way, because it shows the desire of creativity and joy but not in a total transparent way, so also would be great if the machine could be more transparent showing not only what I want to show the world who I am,but the whole spectrum of personality, and that should be great to show in its functionality."},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#group-machines","text":"","title":"Group Machines:"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#in-the-conversationreflection-that-we-had-as-a-group-one-of-the-main-comments-were-that-almost-all-the-machines-that-we-made-were-to-make-an-statement-more-than-reflecting-us-as-individuals-they-were-for-showing-something-to-someone-else-not-just-for-us-for-example-didacs-machine-the-one-with-the-brick-at-the-bottom-was-to-show-in-a-methaphorical-way-when-justice-is-reached-it-a-good-chance-to-new-ideas-or-oportunities-so-it-will-turn-on-a-light-when-the-balance-is-reached","text":"","title":"In the conversation/reflection that we had as a group, one of the main comments were that almost all the machines that we made, were to make an statement, more than reflecting us as individuals, they were for showing something to someone else, not just for us.

We find out that the Robot was much more simple that we imagine, when we resume the functions, in navigation, sensors, hardware, we manage to undertand the main function of it. Then We search for different parts online, to find out what they were, and look for info. \u00b6 Roomba cleaner before dissasebmbly \u00b6 DC motor R500, we look for it in google to see how much the voltage was.then we turned it on with a power source. \u00b6 Some pieces of the roomba, wheels, DC motors, a LOT of plastics parts from the filter. \u00b6 All pieces of the dissasembled roomba. \u00b6 2021 Roomba \u00b6 A world in Data \u00b6 Actity: Find an objective, that can be very local, and can be extrapolated to new opportunities. \u00b6 https://hackmd.io/DoyUHU3PRxqc3-BeWHck3w?view Sense-Making Journal: Loneliness Among Young Adults in Barcelona \u00b6 Project Goals \u00b6 Objective Make young people feel less lonely in Barcelona \u00b6 Question Is instant messaging making young people more lonely than other generations in Barcelona? \u00b6 Hypothesis Instant messaging is making people feel lonely in Barcelona \u00b6 Tips -We think we could have been more definitive while setting the age group. \u00b6 -Linking social media usage and loneliness as an assumption and the only factor. \u00b6 -Generating our own data instead of an external source. \u00b6 The tool we used was Ardurino with LSR sensor to measure light. \u00b6 (###### foto arduino, foto sensor) We had two other options, the web scraper for collecting data about online behaviours or the physical intervention to interact with people for understanding loneliness from different perspectives. \u00b6 Now we are satisfied with the tool we used, but in the future we would add more interactions to it by using audio visual ways of collecting data. \u00b6 Tool usage documentation \u00b6 Data capturing tool set: - Ardurinio board with LDR sensors. \u00b6 Data capturing device, either laptop or a small computer device attached to the Ardurino. Installation: - Face the LDR sensors by bending to directions based on the locations of the people around the table. - Attach the machine to a piece of cardboard and attached to the bottom of the table with tape. - If the LDR sensor does not capture enough light, when the device is too far, cover the device with a diffuser paper for capturing distant light. Capturing data: Data capturing strategy \u00b6 We wanted to see with our data collection, if people use their phones for instant social interactions and messaging even when they have a company around them. \u00b6 Restaurants could be a good place for capturing this, by seeing people being together, but some of them use their phones secretly under the table, disconnecting themselves from others. We couldn\u2019t measure it in real life, because we couldn\u2019t install the device without the laptop under the table, so we observed if this is a valid case by visiting restaurants during lunch time around Poblenou. \u00b6 The findings: - When people are alone, they don\u2019t just focus on their lunch, but they interact with their phones \u00b6 When people want to use their phones in company, they do this under the table, to not show Materials needed \u00b6 arduino board jumper wires LDR light sensors (4) breadboard 10k transistors (4) usb cable to power cardboard masking tape phone Data collected \u00b6 We used a serial monitor at first to give us a visual representation of the light changes then used CSV to give us a numerical output which represents the same information in another fashion. The CSV is able to give us the tabular data to evaluate in further steps. \u00b6 We gave each sensor its own line so that theoretically, if there were multiple phones, we could see which direction the light was coming from. We could identify micro changes based on the different curve points the light intensity from differing media apps which are based on how users usually interact with and navigate them. \u00b6 Tips \u00b6 The data that was collected was only when the device was used under the table. No data was gathered when it is used above the table. The usage was calculated precisely only when the device was on full brightness mode. Dark mode might mess with the data and might miss the usage. The sensor works to its full potential only in dark environments. To connect it through internet so that we didn\u2019t have to use the wires and be restricted. Data insights \u00b6 The amount of time spent on an app can be a window into what kind of connection the user needs or desires. The sudden spike and fall of data graph represents the speed of the scrolling activity. This maybe can be an indication of the mood of the person- maybe how anxious the person is. Frequency of use- how often is the urge to use phone when already in a social situation? How often the spikes change between apps could indicate the attention span or focus of a person No phone \u00b6 Four sensors are turned on, but detecting almost no light. Instagram \u00b6 Every peak is a scroll down, at the left is a slow scrolling, in the right its a fast scrolling (Anxious people?) Whatsapp \u00b6 Photo browsing \u00b6 The flat areas show less movement in the screen. Gmail \u00b6 the interface of gmail is practically white, so there are no radical changes in the brightness. Tips \u00b6 Future steps for the experiment: Increase number of sensors across different tables Make them unattached from the computer to be more discreet(using arduino feather with wifi data transfer) Identify further connections between media app usage and loneliness Use unbiased test subjects Test in crowded, social environments Reflection I had found profoundly interesting this course, from forensics of the obsolescence to world of Data, there has been so many insights, concepts, discoveries from the teachers and us, that is necessary to order it by different areas and acttivities. \u00b6 1.Dissasembling roomba/Forensics I liked very much this activitie, because i have been disasembling things since I was a kid, so it have an emotional factor as well. We manage to disasemble by team, a roomba. Analising its parts, components, electronic hardware, etc. Also we managed to turn on a motor using a power source, understanding some concepts of electronics, and understanding the value of spare pieces in technological trash. Also was super interesting that we can see at the same time, the class doing the same exersice with different things, so even we dissasemble one thing, we managed to understand a lot about evreryone. \u00b6 2.Tools reverse auction An interesting activity that we did, was the reverse auction of tools, where each group had to think of wich tool is better to each project, and then debate about wich tool is better or worst to the activitty. That is a very desafing process because we nad to resolve how to recollect data with that specific tool. \u00b6 3.Data analysing For me, this is the most interesting topic, because I realized that is possible to make all new ways of data recolecting beyond cualitative or quantitative information. Imagine new ways of data recolection and analisis has been the most learning from this course. \u00b6","title":"Tech beyond myth"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Tech%20beyond%20myth/#week-6","text":"","title":"Week 6"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Tech%20beyond%20myth/#tech-beyond-myth","text":"Teachers: Guillem Camprodon Victor Barberan Oscar Gonzalez Santiago Fuentemilla","title":"Tech Beyond Myth"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Tech%20beyond%20myth/#forensics-of-the-obsolescence","text":"We manage to disasemble diferent thigs, like a Irobot Roomba, A tv, a Macbook. and then we had to analize them in very different ways, and documented here. https://hackmd.io/INk2gThpSkObQQ_E62gxow?both","title":"Forensics of the obsolescence"},{"location":"seminars/Term%201/Tech%20beyond%20myth/#we-manage-to-disasemble-a-roomba-robot-by-team-it-was-a-very-interesting-choice-because-is-a-very-multifuntional-robot-that-have-motors-wheels-and-sensors-we-find-out-that-the-robot-was-much-more-simple-that-we-imagine-when-we-resume-the-functions-in-navigation-sensors-hardware-we-manage-to-undertand-the-main-function-of-it-then-we-search-for-different-parts-online-to-find-out-what-they-were-and-look-for-info","text":"","title":"We manage to disasemble a Roomba Robot by team, It was a very interesting choice, because is a very multifuntional robot, that have motors, wheels and sensors.

The team was made by designers, structural engeneers, material experts, psicologysts, and more.

The Magic machine. \u00b6 The magic machine exersice looking it from now, was a groundbreaking exersice for my journey. In a way, it make me define from my own consciousness, what are my actual interests, and what moves me from my guts. In that case, i made a machine that makes music and its so simple that it can be played by everyone. So that shows my interest for making musical, technological and simple ways that improve peoples lives. Also I will use that exercise with my students back in Chile, because to find something that interest us from very deep sometimes is very difficult, and with this tool, it can be much easier, it work different with every people but it was a very insight and successful exercise. 2. 1PP Video \u00b6 The 1 person perspective video also was a Second exersice that gave to me a lot of learnings from it. Having the focus on only one task for a day is something that i think that i had not experience before, and it give to me a lot of insights. The improvisation in the exersice of design, opens a new creative way of doing things for me. My design process starts all the time with a pencil and a paper, seated in my desk triyng to figure things out. In this case I didn\u00b4t grab my pen, neither my notebook, just from the moment that I woke up, i started improvising by the normal daily activities. that released me from the \u201cdesigner\u201d point of view, to the 1PP and participant way of view. So i started doing thing in a very fluid and efficient way, moving from one activitie to another, almost like an artist in his/her attelier, just creating. At the end of the exersice, I realise that I had commited my objective, that was creating something physical, from music. So when I complete that, I ended the day. 3. Scale Diagram \u00b6 The scale diagram that mariana showed us in the weak signals lecture, its the next step from 1PP design, going forward from us in the center, to a global context. I had work with iniciatives that goes from local to global, but with this tool, I realized that the stages in the middle are very important, and that its almost mandatory to make all the steps to move in a bigger or in a down scale. This level of analizing projects or different subjects, leads to a sistemic way understanding a project in its complete context. Also with the content of the recent lecture, we can add another axis to the graph. I have realized that time cannot be lef apart because it is crucial to understand what has happened before, to speculate what is going to happen in the different scales in upcoming futures. Reflection 1st term What \u00b6 Investigation about how the intersection of fabrication, design, music and social impact, can lead to new projects in the emergent futures. Understanding the music as an energy that transform our physical world, and Design as a vehicle of conscient and focused creation with specific people in a specific context. Why? \u00b6 I find in music, a mysterious way to get things done. Some people use it for sports, some other for relax, and some other just to enjoy. In my case, I play electric guitar, experimenting and exploring sound. Also i come from a family of Musicians, My grandfather was an orchestra director back in Chile, and also a cultural gestor, funding the juvenile orchestra foundation for kids with low resources. thats where i saw that music can change peoples lives. The same kind of impact I noticed in design when I worked with young people with Epidermolysis Bullosa (Butterfly skin) developing products to improve their daily life. Noticing that involving in some others life, with simple, low tech and creative solutions, can make a huge impact in their way of living. So in this investigation, im crossing two things that I love, Music and the physical world of design. Now what \u00b6 Now it\u2019s time to summarize all the learnings and experiments that I have made in the first term and reflect about it. It\u2019s necessary to find and activate the community where the project can affect in a positive way or make a real impact. At first im looking for musicians that are interested to collaborate with this in an experimental way. Also looking for places, clubs, foundations, etc, that gather this kind of people, and are interested in non traditional ways of showing a music spectacle. Designers, Sonar artist of materialist, are some other people that I would like to connect with, Because it would be a great opportunity to collaborate and enrich the process. Comparison with past actions \u00b6 In first term, I made 7 experiments that relate low tech, music, energy, frequencies, fractals and materials. It was an interesting straight forward process, where I open the relation of music and fabrication. All of the experiments were made by me, in my studio. So for the second term I will aim to involve more people to this process, to hear opinions, look for comments, and co create something. Understanding that the music and creating experience is more rich, when it is collaborative. what if questions \u00b6 -What if I connect with musicians and artist in a local intervention? -what if I use a self made piece of music to fabricate something. -What if I look for this relation in urban spaces? -What if I connect people to create this things in a distributed way(Online) -What if I use AI or other systems to automatize the process of creation? -What if I make a public design intervention, using using to materialize something? -What If I work with people who don\u2019t have nothing to do with music? Design Intervention 2.0 \u00b6 OPEN JAM The second version of the design intervention will be to enable people to create, record, and reproduce music easily, accesible, by creating a stand alone open source system without the need of a computer or any complex and expensive device or software. Communities: The community search is open wide to three main subjects, Music exploration, nature and tech projects, and audiovisual installations, where is a interaction between the musical work and people. Related to people, I have found that I have a lot of musical connection with people in Barcelona, Some profesional musicians, and people that I had work with, in musical instruments. Also I had added music spaces that will be able to collaborate to make a public intervention, near my house. In gracia, there is a place called, Soda acustic, where every thursday, they make an experimental music session, just before jams sessions. State of the art: Analyzing my music making devices. I had made a quick tryout with one challenge, wich would be the easiest way to create/record music with more people. At first I had tried with an synth, the OP-1, that is a multitrack, self sufficient device for creating music. It enables to record, sample, and modify each track like the old 4 tape recorders. With the interaction of my classmates, I had noticed that is not that easy to encourage people to create music, if the instruments are made for one person use. Also that the process of playing with sound, sometimes can be even anoying if someone is working in a different thing, So maybe the classroom is not the best place to experiment with sound. From left to right: 1.Boss Loop Station, 2. Zoom audio interface and recorder,3. Pocket operator rythm. This devices are the simplest devices that I have to make and record a musical piece, with the loop. its possible to create a track in a specific amount of time that repeats everytime, and it allows to record or erase another track, just pushing the lid. With the recorder its posible to obtain any sound from the environment, to people looks very appealing to record their voices and play with loops. Finally with the PO, its possible to create rythms by just pushing those buttons. This is a sample of a piece of music created with these three devices: The cons of useing this kind of devices is that they run on battery, the are pretty expensive, and no one is open source, they use a lot of non recyclable parts, and they are closed hardware, So there is an opportunity to develop this kind of musical devices and re-thinking them to be used in different contexts. Opening Communities. I went to find a music space that is open to artist, so I found \u201cNocturna Discordia\u201d in soda acoustic, a music bar in my neighborhood, Gracia. Nocturna Discordia is an instance where experimental Music is welcome, they had opened that space since 2012, So its almost 10 years where there has been experimental music, artists, and creators. I went to a concert to experience what nocturna discordia was about, And for my surprise, was actually very interesting and nice. They were a group of musicians that were improvising and they didn\u2019t new between each other before, so the result was also very interesting. because was fully improvisational. (foto musicos en nocturna discordia) After the concert I talked to the vocalist, she was very nice and friendly, I told her was I was doing and she told me about new places like hangar.org or la escosesa, in Poble nou. Th other guy that I talked, was Andr\u00e9s, he is the organizer of the event, and he was very interested and open to see what we were able to do there. I talked him about the plant b project, and we agreed that I have to send him some material, and set a date to play there. For next steps I will go to hangar and la escosesa so see what we can do, or collaborate. Making a Looper machine with Chris We manage to build a DIY collaborative looper stations called OPENJAM BOX, using raspberry Pi and youtube tutorials to make it work. Our goal was to build some musical project that would be easy to build and program, and we manage to find the tutorial for a multitrack looper. and we transformit into a looper that enable more people to create music together, so the initial design is meant to be used by four people, where they can record and play a track. All info related to the looper is in https://github.com/chris-ernst/fablab-challenge-1 Design intervention Planing Continuing to exploring my question about how music can change physical realities. So the intervention consist to make an instance were people will modify clay figures related to the music that they are listening. So this are the planned steps related to the intervention. 1.- Bring the clay and guitar(my instrument) to the class 2.- I will invite the classmates to sit in front of three or four clay balls, and I will guide them through to tell them that the can modify the pieces while listening to music, so each figure will represent a moment. Also I will ask them to be \u201cblind\u201d to make the sense of listening better. 3.- It should be some classmate that would help me to record this intervention. 4.-I will record each track to use it later with the fogures. 5.-The results will be documented in pictures with collab and 3d scanning and printing. 6.- The final result will be a collaborative and meaningfull series of objects. This process will be fully of improvistation, so I dont want to practice what I will play, or to tell them what to do, will be free.","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#week-13","text":"","title":"Week 13"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#term-2","text":"","title":"TERM 2"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"Teachers: Oscar Tomico Tom\u00e1s Vivanco Mariana Quintero","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#goals-for-the-second-term","text":"-Grow our community -Project bottoms up -Refine personal Identity -Learn of new materials and tools","title":"Goals for the second term:"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#three-learnings-from-the-first-term","text":"","title":"Three learnings from the first term:"},{"location":"seminars/Term%202/Design%20Studio/#1-the-magic-machine","text":"The magic machine exersice looking it from now, was a groundbreaking exersice for my journey.

She aims to question our interaction with materials, Re-design of materials, customize properties, and mixing it with contemporary process. Material/Culture/Nature Reflection Sesion 2 We manage to cook diffent recipies of biomaterials. Agar Agar: \u00b6 I had worked before with agar agar, mixing it with more organic waste, like coffe, corn starch, and different peels. The thing I didnt know is that here in spain its also a very abundant product in the coast, so its not something that is imported and not local, that is great for the environment, and also a potential resource. Alginate: \u00b6 I had worked with alginate before, but I didnt notice that it is possible to work with it in different formats, as people use it in molecular food, making it react with another components, it gets hard by time. Pine resin: \u00b6 this is an interesting binder that I had never used before. It is very interesting because the difference between Agar Agar and gelatine, is that it dries very fast and doesn\u2019t shrinks very much as the other ones, And that is pretty good for design purposes, because the shrinkage percentage is crucial to any design desition. fabric used for agar agar and gelatin moulds Materials and ingredients used ion the process Pine resin mix with Coffee Biomaterials samples cooked in the second sesion The fabric is used for the material to stick and don\u2019t shrink that much. Properties of the material. I chose the material made with pine resin and wax recipe, mixed with organge peel. At first it looks very interesting because depending on the grain size, its possible to identify the orange and yellow color of the peel, thats is interesting because it makes the appearence of the material unique. I tried to smell the material as well, because as it is made of orange, its suposed to smell like orange peel, But with time that smell goes away, I think that is because of the pine resin that has its own smell and properties. The mechanical properties are not that high, with a bit of strenght the material breaks easily. As its made with hand preasure, it has one side much slipery than the other, that its parameter to consider while its being fabricated. It would be very interesting to see how this material can resemble the orange smell nice propertie, because is something that is very common for almost everyone that eats orange, so the material could gather meaningfullnes by its smell and memory. Material designers and projects. Squeeze the Orange \u00b6 Research of biomaterials from orange peel. Materiom \u00b6 Open source Biomaterial Library. FabLab U. de Chile \u00b6 Research of local waste and developing technologies and tools to go further with biomaterial fabrication. Breadcrumbs waste as a material. Me and Jos\u00e9 did an exploration with bread crumbs, agar agar and pine resin. Sample of breadcrumbs and pine resin Sample of breadcrumbs and agar agar We figure that as we are working with food, the possibilities of reusing bread crumbs are on the same path, as agar agar is also edible, we made the sample with a hole in the middle, so it has the possibility to be hanged in trees, to give it as food to birds in the eighborhood. Its interesting to see that just \u201crelocating\u201d the waste to the same purpose can have a nice way to impoact the environment, in this case it has the possiblilty to atract pidgeons to places that are not that crowded. Agar agar sample hanging in the tree More info of the project of Bread Crumbs can be founded here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bfWTQE6fajpcnCwdZSG8ggF9suYxF7SznpOskbxr8sU/edit?usp=sharing analizing properties and future aplications. The samples with both mixtures were very different, the one with pine resin was very hard but easy to brake, and the one with agar agar, as we managed the amount of glycerin, it was pretty flexible, and resistant, but that sample also shrinked much more than the pine resin one. We will continue to explore the mixture with bread crumbs, because we think that is a very good oportunity to use local bakeryes waste, as In Barcelona, eat fresh bread is very common, almost all bakeries have the machine to cut the bread, so its possible to get from almost all bakeries. Reflection: \u00b6 This Sesion has been interesting to my biomaterial knowledge, because it has been great to see my peers working and creating with this kind of materials, and exploring new ways of directing biomaterial research. Its also very nice to see that there are so mamny projects in development related to biomaterials here in Europe.

The number of possible futures is endless, so we have to be concient that its not a singular one. Definition of futures for me: A vector or a direction that sometimes we take for granted, we dream of, or we chase. Definitions for my classmates: Collective result of actions/Energy/a cone that it stretching out/presents that are going to be/ Collective desire/ something that we imagine/ The future is only in our minds. The everything manifesto \u00b6 https://medium.com/iam-journal/the-everything-manifesto-a-thought-experiment-for-the-next-billion-seconds-bcd9b9c938dc General concepts: \u00b6 Definition of everything Sistemic changes rather than solutions Climate emergency rather than climate change We are citizens with rights and responsabilities. The ones that have more, have more responsabilities in our society Design for solidarity. Words change worlds Definitions: \u00b6 WTF in internet: \u00b6 The internet for me is other level of consciousness of the human being, because it makes possible the connection between humans, (in a very fast speed) independently where you are. It has the bad thing is that it gives me the feeling that internet is embodied to ourselves, so we can\u2019t live without it anymore. In that case I think that it has become part of the humanity itself, and the devices that we are using right now are going to be more and more embodied till we became one thing only. WTF is Time: #### \u00b6 Time for me is a verbalization of existence, that we as humans have named for ourselves, to give some order in how we go in a civilized way, for organising daily activities, or just wake up in the morning, in a way, time it\u2019s a way of how we measure our existence and life. Exercise 1: \u00b6 Imagine yourself in the next billion second and answer this questions. A day in my post technological life How young will you be in 2052? Think about your morning routine.. What can change? What are you having for breakfast? How would you like to move around? What other kinds of occupations can exist? How do we create and exchange value? What are you eating? E-commerce is a huge thing today\u2026 how can it change? How is your social life? What\u2019s on your mind before turning off? What kind of topics will you be reading about? If you have 3 more extra hours \u201cEvery now and then say WTF!\u201d ;) New concept of Time, TedX \u00b6 We are circadian organisms that function with the power of the sun, in some places it work that way, but now we are disconnected from that concept so much, that we don\u2019t make a good use of resources because of that. We spend a lot of energy iluminating our nightlife, much more that woring about living with the natural life of the sun. In a case, the other \u201ckingdoms\u201d work with their circadians cicles naturally. Plants, insects, mushrooms, averyone has its own rythm of life. As technology goes forward, we are even more far from our cycle because of the human interference and our definition of time and productivity. Since we are childs, we lear that time is priceless and that we have to make it profitable. \u201d To live in harmony with nature we should harmonise with it\u201d The great awareness \u00b6 Andr\u00e9s Colmenares Its a tale of Andr\u00e9s, talking about the present and futures, how technology and socio-political subjects have changed over time and over our own imagination. In the tale, he talk about longer life, a new pandemic, migrants issues, crush of networks, hibernation, capitalism, and fall of the power. The Geat Silence \u00b6 It is a very interesting article about a parrot communicating with humans, the great silence make a direct reference to extincion of species, and how in a way, humans are headed in that direction. How loosing language, rituals, tradition, take us to direct failure about ourselves, because we tend to think that we are unique, and that we are more valuable than any other organism. With the Fermi paradox, the great silence also makes allusion to outer space life, and if there is life outside, for protection, they are been avoiding contact, because of selfcaring from humans. Letter to 1990 \u00b6 In this exercise, we had to write a letter to someone in the 90\u2019s. I choose my father, because he was a huge fan of time, technology, science fiction, and a lot of things that now are very different of how he imagined would be. In the letter I To Felipe Hello Bold man !, I\u2019m sorry to tell you but in the future you will be Bold. I am Joaquin, from a billion seconds in the future. I know you are good at calculations, but to save you work, it is about 30 years. \u00b6 Can you imagine wanting to have a video chat with someone anywhere in the world, whenever you want? Just look at your briefcase that you use to call Drina, your wife, or Octavio at your work, that heavy thing that must have cost you a lot, that you surely brought it from the USA, (that continues to happen today). Now imagine that this briefcase is a device that is the size of the palm of your hand, it is rectangular, with a color touch screen and you use it with your fingers. Now with that device, being much more powerful and faster than the PC windows you use, you can surf the Internet (almost at instant speed), take photos, watch videos, imagine! You can connect with all your friends that you stopped seeing. You must be thinking, that we are like in Star Trek, but don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a long way to go for that. Millionaires are beginning to travel into space, but not in ships like the Enterprise at warp speed, but rather phallic shaped ships, similar to a rocket and just to experience zero gravity. What you might like is that we are in a new space race, but to Mars! We\u2019re not there yet, but it won\u2019t be long. I hope I don\u2019t disappoint you. \u00b6 I know that in Chile they are just returning to democracy, the worst is over. Today if you knew, today Gabriel Boric has just been elected, he is 35 years old, he started as a student leader, he is part of the broad front (similar to the PS but younger) and he has not stopped participating in politics until today. we are happy and hopeful that it will be a better country.

In fact, I have an album there, don\u2019t think I\u2019m a rockstar, now anyone can create music from their room and create whatever. Walkmans, cassettes, are a thing of the past, but curiously we continue to listen to music on vinyl, it is a kind of fashion that doesn\u2019t make much sense, but as you know, fashions are fashions. \u00b6 I know you are wondering about your field. The agronomy continues to grow, the Chinese continue to buy cherries like crazy, the harvest is now mechanized, despite the fact that many people (mainly immigrants) continue to work almost all day in mechanical work that is still expensive to replace. Surely you are already thinking of something for that. And what carries it today are the fungi, today the Mycelium is being investigated as a construction material, insulation, even as a leather to dress. What madness no ?. \u00b6 Well, a billion seconds or 30 years can dream a lot, some things like technology advance very fast, even though we don\u2019t have big wars, we are going through a world pandemic, which thanks to globalization, affected us all, and made us Realizing that we are a great organism and that we move forward together in this ship called earth, you will imagine that some of us understand it but others still do not understand it. \u00b6 Now enjoy what you have left with a daughter because I am born early, I am not going to tell you the date to make it a surprise, but I am a Piscis.I love you very much, and see you in a year.Your son. \u00b6 Ps: you have two grandchildren (from Pindi) Antonia and Santiago, I married a beautiful woman, Angelita.

Green growth possibilities Talk by Giorgios Kallis In the talk, giorgios talks about degrowth and its real possiblities in our capitalism society. He talks about a very interesting concept, \u201cDecoupling\u201d that makes reference to the separation of economy growth to the environmental impact in countries. He shows how the concept of resource vary from different countries and societies. \u201cimagine an scenario wehere we don\u2019t have all the things that we want right now, well, that is degrowth, is that terrible? It\u00b4s something that requires drastic redesing and work.\u201d If we short the hours of work, maybe there will be more space to more people to be able to work.
