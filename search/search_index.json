Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. \u00b6 The Atlas of weak signals is a very interesting tool that helps to connect subjects and extreme postures, aslo appearing a lot of new subjects that surprised me because I had never heard about them, so is interesting as well to see the diversity of areas that we can investigate and work. Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities. 3. Screenshots of your collaborative design space \u00b6 1. How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? \u00b6 In the collserolla Trip, we had a very good time talking beetween classmates, and there we had to take with us only one weak signal, so that make us decide and talk to each other about our choices. That was very interesting because we share opinions, previous projects that we knew, and knowledge about every subject. Also being in the park was a perfect instance to disconnect and just talk about the topic. 1.

Oxman, M. Kayser, J. Laucks and M. Firstenberg Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA Neri Oxman job has allways impressed me, the first time I saw the silk pavilion, I was amazed about the concept about collaborating with nature instead of make nature work for humans. The sinergy beetween technology, digital fabrication and technological systems is very well designed. the process of obtainnig the silk, has been for hundreds of years a process againts nature, because normally the cocoons of silk are boiled to separate the silk, killing the worms, growed in farms and in a non organic way. The interesting thing about this new process, Is that they propose a new way to extract sik without killing the worms, by letting them to wove their cocoons, and at the same time, evolve into the next stage of the larva. I picked this paper to understand in an specific way, how this ingestigation started, how the probes were made, to understand how is possible to work with this organic systems and to create new ways of manufacture. Sumary 3d printing vs natural fabrication 3D printing traditional methods, are very funtional in a way, but it is not as efficient as natural fabrication, like spider webs, birds nests, or worm silk, wich contruction is organic and high efficient, ussing the less resource ass posible, working in an incredible way, so that statement opens a new investigation direction, where the natural procesess inspired humands, to develop new methods of manufacture. Fiber orientation \u201cUsing additive manu- facturing technologies are much less sustainable: from a material perspective - homogeneous materi- als offer less potential for structural optimization; and from a fabrication perspective - additive manu- factured components are constructed in layers, rely- ing on the deposition of significant amounts of wasted support material\u201d The fiber construction method is very effective, because it uses a high resistant material, to the purpose of protecting the cocoon, till it reaches its evolving stage, the puppa. One cocoon has more than a kilometer long, and its deposited in the most efficient way. About silk Silk is an amazing material, its one of the most high ended, exensive and old materials recolected by humans, its used to make clothes, fibers, and its used in textile industry and medicine. The silk as a material also has a binder, the cericin. The worm makes the cocoon using its own environment attaching the silk into different points. Motion tracking In the reaserch, they installed a worm into a acrilic box, and they used different of cameras to analyse how many points of contact were used by the worm to make the sik structure, concluding that they were more than 1.000.000 points of contact. that motion track, encouraged the team to speculate about a robotic process of fabrication. Fiber based robot simulating construction Using a Kuka robot, they manage to install a headset to the robotic arm, that deposit HDPE, a termoplastic that can be used for 3d printing. Also they conclude that changing the extrude power and speed of the headset, would be possible to vary in density, thikness and quality of the material. Also they simulated the contact points with hook on the wall, enabling the robotig arm to create HDPE structures based on the silk worm funtion. Images: Making a mutant Reflection This set of lectures, were very interesting and inspiring because from the biology point of view, my interest in grow almost anything, has to do a lot. Also for me, is necesarry to know the basics of biology, if im going to work with biofabrication, biomaterials and living organisms. I also would be using a lot my toolbox network, to contact profesionals if I have more doubts about biology. The only comment that I would do to Nuria is that in some parts, the concepts were too \u201cscientific\u201d, so I get lost sometimes in the terminology, but with a bit of asking and time, I was able to understand the main concepts. Also all the practical area in both Bio / Agri, were very insightfull, because we were able to see how a lot of things work, like how to grow bacterias, or how to work in a sterile environment. That are totally usefull things that I will be useing for shure along the master. For de Agri Zero week, I found that im much more interested and related to the conuntryside that I was aware. All my youth I used to lived in the countryside of Curic\u00f3, a city in the middle south of Chile, famous for its Vineyards and fields for agriculture.

I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future \u00b6 My poster reflects how the future should be, in my perspective, there has to be people \u201cjoining the dots\u201d, unifying the creative aspects and profesions, with citizens and people, as Victor Papanek said, Design can be a very well use tool, or the most dangerous carreer of all. The main thing is that design can change realities, points of view, and the most important, can improve peoples lifes. 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. \u00b6 My Identity is very powerfull as a designer itself, from a long time ago, I started designing even before start going to Design school, Almost every Sunday, I tried to create something interesting and usefull. My skills are maily from building things, related to design, crafts and arts, to beaing an easy learner in some aspects, I have to recognize that electronics and programming are a bit difficult for me to learn. Related to my attitude, I feel like a very positive person, allways trying to go for the bright side, aalso trying to be a fresh person, related to people, and new knowledge that is arround. Also Im very Open and confident about the things that I do, and im very bad to say No to challenges. My knowledge goes mainly in creative ways, like design, arts, materials, methodologies, etc. I find myself like a \u201d sea of 1mm of depth\u201d because I love to learn and do a lot but mainly with no depth in everything 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude \u00b6 With the meetings I had found that I had been atracted to lear programming and coding as some classmates, but it allways goes to nothing, because I don\u00b4t keep practising it, and when I had the chance, in FabLab U. de Chile, I had been \u201csafe\u201d in my own knowledge and tasks. So thats a very interesting challenge for me. Also im beginning to interest in new subjects, as AI, VR, and Biology. 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity \u00b6 My new professional Identity, would be like an digital fabrication designer + Technological tools, like programming and the use of electronics in projects. I would love to learn more about it in \u201cTech beyond myth\u201d 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). \u00b6 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program. \u00b6 I had made a circular draft for the first term, because I think that the 1st term process is circular, not returning to zero, but to gain the experience of the courses and become a \u201cnew me\u201d with all the new knowledge and experiences.

Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on \u201cyour new me\u201d and create a \u201cnew workspace\u201d. I had created a new workspace based on my new investigation subject, I started with the subject \u201d How to grow almost anything\u201d, but its interesting how the subject starts to grow itself. My new workspace have new areas, like an instagram page, where im collecting all of the \u201cgrowed\u201d things that I find dalyly, like parrots nest on a light tower, or furballs made by peoples hair in transtation, thats a very nice activity to do because it feeds the workspace almost everyday with things that I see everyday. Also I had added a \u201cfield notes\u201d part, because I like to write notes of everything that I see, classes, talks, conversations, Ideas. Its comfortable to have that Pages visually in the design space, also is material to share with my classmates. Im adding as well state of the art projects, to see what can I learn from them, and what its missing in that state, Would be great to found some new ways in the field. I had notice that my studio relates to two main fields, materials and energy, so I will focus my project In that direction. I will make profund observation of this subjects in the process of the master. 2. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in (onion mapping from the Atlas) and add them to your design space. My way of prototiping, at the moment has been near to different Roles, at first I thought that my process was accumulative, going deeper into the \u201cgrow\u201d subject, but I have realised that the concept is more abstract, that only grow biological things, so It has been a mix of comparative, and probing as well. 3. Do your first design experiment applying one or different roles of prototyping. Experiments: Details of the experiments are in the \u201cProject\u201d tab. Grow Materials to generate something Usefull. The first experiment starts from the question of \u201cCan I add value to some existing object, growing something into it? The first experiment was to grow salt cristals in an earing, showing in a simple way, that a growed system can add value to a simple object as an earing. Also in terms of time, jewellery is very acord because the salt don\u00b4t need that much time to grow in it. 2)Make an action that normally you will use an object to acomplish, with the minimum resources. I had saw that technique in youtube, to see underwater only with my hands, I do it all the time when I dont have my snorkelling googles. This experiment has amazed me because the concept of useing nothing but your body to make a task, is something that we don\u00b4t question that much in our normal lifes, we allways think that we need \u201csomething\u201d to archieve our goals, for example if we teach our children to do this technique, we are avoiding buying that cheap snorkeling googles that are selled on the beach, used once and thtown away, because they were broken, bad quality, or the kid wasnt interested anymore. 3)Using natures energy to create something The third one aims to use the mechanical energy of living organisms to enable them to comunicate with humans when they move.(output) For this project I had used the energy of the Carnivore plant, so when it picked a bug or a fly, it will move and let me know when it catches something. For the experiment I had attached to aluminum foil, because of the weight, to each leaf of the plant, and the foil were connected to an arduino with the Led program, so the foils were the \u201ccircuit cut\u201d, and when they get togheter, they turn the Led On. This project made me wonder a lot of questions, for example how would be to work with nature, and not nature work for you, also the moving \u201cenergy\u201d of the plant is a very interesting way to keep investigating natural and not conventional uses of energy..

My Magic machine: \u00b6 The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one. Also the machine is kind of a mask in a way, because it shows the desire of creativity and joy but not in a total transparent way, so also would be great if the machine could be more transparent showing not only what I want to show the world who I am,but the whole spectrum of personality, and that should be great to show in its functionality. Group Machines: \u00b6 In the conversation/reflection that we had as a group, one of the main comments were that almost all the machines that we made, were to make an statement, more than reflecting us as individuals, they were for showing something to someone else, not just for us. For example Didacs machine, the one with the brick at the bottom, was to show in a methaphorical way, when justice is reached, it a good chance to new ideas or oportunities, so it will turn on a light, when the balance is reached. Another observation that we made as a group was that at the same time, we aim to things that are right, or things that make possitive ways to funtion and for others, rather than random ideas. One thing that i learned is how the materiality of objects, can lead to different interpretations of reality and can make people to connect with very deep and abstract ideas, making this exersice a great vehicle for creativity and connection with our selfs, and our thoughts and emotions in the context that we are or in a context that we want to be. THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE / 1PP \u00b6 Concepts: \u00b6 -Auto ethnography -Radical thinking -Change yourself -Extreme situations -Design Intervention https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDu9yRFaVko I started with the Question, Can be the Music a potential \u201cenergy\u201d to materialize something? Recomendation from teachers: Keep it close, do a lot of experiments, \u201csee what happens\u201d, the restriction: Had to be music made by me, not others. From the magical machines exersice, I had realized that I allways persue music as a creative way to build something, as a non profesional musician, Im allways trying to mix music with my projects. So in this case, I started doing a musical breakfast, so I recorded every step of making a normal breakfast and then I manage to edit it in different ways in Logic pro,A music composer software. At first I joined all the sounds to sound at the same time, then I arranged it in a random order to see what would happen, then I ordered the sounds in a logical way to make them more pleasant to the ear. the result was very tipical so I moved forward. then I took the shaving machine, and started to shave myself in a musical rythm, then I realized that the hairs of my face, were like little dots in a pentagram, so I manage to order those hairs in a musical pentagram, and that action lead me to pick my guitar and play somethig inspired from that action. When I reached my guitar I htried different ways the musical amp make noise and energy, I realized that the bass notes were powerfull and moved more air compared to the treble, so I realized that I can puth thing to see that movenment of the speaker. then I moved forward adding a white paper and different types of dust, to see how it would change with different bass notes. Finally I manage to solidify the dust with some glue, at the same time that the speaker was moving, so I had created a unique shape mixing the material and the energy, with that result, I had answered my question, with a very promisin direction. via GIPHY A guide to successfull Auto Ethnography \u00b6 Define Study Boundaries: \u00b6 My limits were determined principaly by the question I made, It was the starting point, but open to changes, The main thing was the direction, that was to materialize something with/by music. Maybe some boundarie was the time (a day) and the place, because I determine that the place should be my work/music room, using thingsthat I allready had in that specific time and place. Authenticity: \u00b6 At first, when I begun the experiment, It felt not that authentic, because I had seen a lot of this before, on social network, or youtube. The next step was way more authentic(musical shaving) because my brain allready was on a mood of doing something different, and different conection with things that normally wouldnt be connected on this subject, for example grabbing my facial hair and pur it on a music pentagram, to make \u201cmusic notes\u201d, and that was very inspiring for grabing an instrument and start creating music. Plausibility \u00b6 It relates with my personal interests ( Music and fabrication) and how I made them to work toghether. Also I think that I can add more value, exploring creativity from these areas and join points that I had never thinked before, like music and fabrication. Criticality \u00b6 This projects gathers very technical and abstract concepts. The 1PP exersice put me on a very different starting point, from beng too methodogical, to start creating from a very fast and plastic state of mind, The mindset from the initial question, kept me motivated to make things different than usual. Self reavealing comunication. (honesty) \u00b6 My project was made under a stream of consciousnes, so I think that was also very honest made. Using no filters to each activity. The thing that I missed, was to show my emotions and thoughts in the video, because in every discovery, I was a very exited, where I knew that the emotions had a lot to give. Maybe the documentation is sometimes an obstacle to work freely. Ethnographic material with confesional content. \u00b6 For this experiment, I made very personal actions, like playing guitar in my house. The video itself was not that confetional, because the actions were guided through a secuencial time. Maybe the most personal thing is that the subjects that I worked, are very related to my passions. Generalizability \u00b6 The Idea of manufacture with music, can be very interesting for other musicians, designers, scientist, sound engeneers, etc. It is in a very initial stage, but it can be extrapolated into a different area and context, to give and involve more meaning for others. I totally would use these exersise in the future, for different tasks. What happen when I envolved myself / as an instrument? \u00b6 I enyoed this process in a very insightfull way, it was like entering in a totally diferent state of mind with no stops, also with a lot of emotions happening at the same time. I felt also that this exersise was the push that I needed to start a project from a totally different aproach, from this vulnerable position from myself. Did anything change about the way of working? \u00b6 It was kind of revealing to work in this way, It allowed me to move faster into the challenges in a much more creative way and with less constrains, Also it makes the process very enjoyable, personal and intense. Coments about my colective videos \u00b6 I feel very inspired by the work of my collective, at first it was difficult to find similarities, but after analizing and speaking with my classmates, we find that the concepts behind each video, had a lot of crossing concepts viewed from different perspcetives, but with the same goal, or the same intention.","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#week-5","text":"","title":"Week 5"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Teachers: Kristina Anderson Oscar Tomico Angela Mackey","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#myself-drawing-in-a-minute","text":"","title":"Myself Drawing in a minute:"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#_1","text":"I picture myself as a very big guy with a pencil in a hand, and a guitar for making music, also with open arms reminding me that I have to be open to new ideas, also in a forest, because i allways like to be arround nature.","title":""},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#my-magic-machine","text":"The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one.

Hypothesis Instant messaging is making people feel lonely in Barcelona Tips -We think we could have been more definitive while setting the age group. -Linking social media usage and loneliness as an assumption and the only factor. -Generating our own data instead of an external source. The tool we used was Ardurino with LSR sensor to measure light. (foto arduino, foto sensor) We had two other options, the web scraper for collecting data about online behaviours or the physical intervention to interact with people for understanding loneliness from different perspectives. Now we are satisfied with the tool we used, but in the future we would add more interactions to it by using audio visual ways of collecting data. Tool usage documentation \u00b6 Data capturing tool set: - Ardurinio board with LDR sensors. - Data capturing device, either laptop or a small computer device attached to the Ardurino. Installation: - Face the LDR sensors by bending to directions based on the locations of the people around the table. - Attach the machine to a piece of cardboard and attached to the bottom of the table with tape. - If the LDR sensor does not capture enough light, when the device is too far, cover the device with a diffuser paper for capturing distant light. Capturing data: Data capturing strategy \u00b6 We wanted to see with our data collection, if people use their phones for instant social interactions and messaging even when they have a company around them. Restaurants could be a good place for capturing this, by seeing people being together, but some of them use their phones secretly under the table, disconnecting themselves from others. We couldn\u2019t measure it in real life, because we couldn\u2019t install the device without the laptop under the table, so we observed if this is a valid case by visiting restaurants during lunch time around Poblenou. The findings: - When people are alone, they don\u2019t just focus on their lunch, but they interact with their phones - When people want to use their phones in company, they do this under the table, to not show Materials needed \u00b6 arduino board jumper wires LDR light sensors (4) breadboard 10k transistors (4) usb cable to power cardboard masking tape phone Data collected \u00b6 ![](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-a8061346e2ee.gif) We used a serial monitor at first to give us a visual representation of the light changes then used CSV to give us a numerical output which represents the same information in another fashion. The CSV is able to give us the tabular data to evaluate in further steps. We gave each sensor its own line so that theoretically, if there were multiple phones, we could see which direction the light was coming from. We could identify micro changes based on the different curve points the light intensity from differing media apps which are based on how users usually interact with and navigate them. ![](../images/WD1.png) #### Tips - The data that was collected was only when the device was used under the table. No data was gathered when it is used above the table. - The usage was calculated precisely only when the device was on full brightness mode. Dark mode might mess with the data and might miss the usage. - The sensor works to its full potential only in dark environments. - To connect it through internet so that we didn't have to use the wires and be restricted. ### Data insights - The amount of time spent on an app can be a window into what kind of connection the user needs or desires. - The sudden spike and fall of data graph represents the speed of the scrolling activity. This maybe can be an indication of the mood of the person- maybe how anxious the person is. - Frequency of use- how often is the urge to use phone when already in a social situation? - How often the spikes change between apps could indicate the attention span or focus of a person #### No phone Four sensors are turned on, but detecting almost no light. ![](../images/DT1.png) #### Instagram Every peak is a scroll down, at the left is a slow scrolling, in the right its a fast scrolling (Anxious people?) ![](../images/DT2.png) #### Whatsapp ![](../images/DT3.png) #### Photo browsing The flat areas show less movement in the screen. ![](../images/DT4.png) #### Gmail the interface of gmail is practically white, so there are no radical changes in the brightness. ![](../images/DT5.png) ### Tips Future steps for the experiment: - Increase number of sensors across different tables - Make them unattached from the computer to be more discreet(using arduino feather with wifi data transfer) - Identify further connections between media app usage and loneliness - Use unbiased test subjects - Test in crowded, social environments **Reflection** I had found profoundly interesting this course, from forensics of the obsolescence to world of Data, there has been so many insights, concepts, discoveries from the teachers and us, that is necessary to order it by different areas and acttivities. 1.Dissasembling roomba/Forensics I liked very much this activitie, because i have been disasembling things since I was a kid, so it have an emotional factor as well.
