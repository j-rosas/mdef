Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities. 3.

I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future \u00b6 My poster reflects how the future should be, in my perspective, there has to be people \u201cjoining the dots\u201d, unifying the creative aspects and profesions, with citizens and people, as Victor Papanek said, Design can be a very well use tool, or the most dangerous carreer of all. The main thing is that design can change realities, points of view, and the most important, can improve peoples lifes. 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. \u00b6 My Identity is vey powerfull as a designer itself, from a long time ago, I started designing even before start going to Design school, Almost every Sunday, I tried to create something interesting and usefull. My skills are maily from building things, related to design, crafts and arts, to beaing an easy learner in some aspects, I have to recognize that electronics and programming are a bit difficult for me to learn. Related to my attitude, I feel like a very positive person, allways trying to go for the bright side, aalso trying to be a fresh person, related to people, and new knowledge that is arround. Also Im very Open and confident about the things that I do, and im very bad to say No to challenges. My knowledge goes mainly in creative ways, like design, arts, materials, methodologies, etc. I find myself like a \u201d sea of 1mm of depth\u201d because I love to learn and do a lot but mainly with no depth in everything 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude \u00b6 With the meetings I had found that I had been atracted to lear programming and coding as some classmates, but it allways goes to nothing, because I don\u00b4t keep practising it, and when I had the chance, in FabLab U. de Chile, I had been \u201csafe\u201d in my own knowledge and tasks. So thats a very interesting challenge for me. Also im beginning to interest in new subjects, as AI, VR, and Biology. 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity \u00b6 My new professional Identity, would be like an digital fabrication designer + Technological tools, like programming and the use of electronics in projects. I would love to learn more about it in \u201cTech beyond myth\u201d 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). \u00b6 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program. \u00b6 I had made a circular draft for the first term, because I think that the 1st term process is circular, not returning to zero, but to gain the experience of the courses and become a \u201cnew me\u201d with all the new knowledge and experiences.

My new workspace have new areas, like an instagram page, where im collecting all of the \u201cgrowed\u201d things that I find dalyly, like parrots nest on a light tower, or furballs made by peoples hair in transtation, thats a very nice activity to do because it feeds the workspace almost everyday with things that I see everyday. Also I had added a \u201cfield notes\u201d part, because I like to write notes of everything that I see, classes, talks, conversations, Ideas. Its comfortable to have that Pages visually in the design space, also is material to share with my classmates. Im adding as well state of the art projects, to see what can I learn from them, and what its missing in that state, Would be great to found some new ways in the field. I had notice that my studio relates to two main fields, materials and energy, so I will focus my project In that direction. I will make profund observation of this subjects in the process of the master. 2. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in (onion mapping from the Atlas) and add them to your design space. \u00b6 My way of prototiping, at the moment has been near to different Roles, at first I thought that my process was accumulative, going deeper into the \u201cgrow\u201d subject, but I have realised that the concept is more abstract, that only grow biological things, so It has been a mix of comparative, and probing as well. Do your first design experiment applying one or different roles of prototyping. Experiments: \u00b6 Details of the experiments are in the \u201cProject\u201d tab. 1)Grow Materials to generate something Usefull. \u00b6 The first experiment starts from the question of \u201cCan I add value to some existing object, growing something into it? The first experiment was to grow salt cristals in an earing, showing in a simple way, that a growed system can add value to a simple object as an earing. Also in terms of time, jewellery is very acord because the salt don\u00b4t need that much time to grow in it. 2)Make an action that normally you will use an object to acomplish, with the minimum resources. \u00b6 I had saw that technique in youtube, to see underwater only with my hands, I do it all the time when I dont have my snorkelling googles. This experiment has amazed me because the concept of useing nothing but your body to make a task, is something that we don\u00b4t question that much in our normal lifes, we allways think that we need \u201csomething\u201d to archieve our goals, for example if we teach our children to do this technique, we are avoiding buying that cheap snorkeling googles that are selled on the beach, used once and thtown away, because they were broken, bad quality, or the kid wasnt interested anymore. 3)Using natures energy to create something \u00b6 The third one aims to use the mechanical energy of living organisms to enable them to comunicate with humans when they move.(output) For this project I had used the energy of the Carnivore plant, so when it picked a bug or a fly, it will move and let me know when it catches something. For the experiment I had attached to aluminum foil, because of the weight, to each leaf of the plant, and the foil were connected to an arduino with the Led program, so the foils were the \u201ccircuit cut\u201d, and when they get togheter, they turn the Led On. This project made me wonder a lot of questions, for example how would be to work with nature, and not nature work for you, also the moving \u201cenergy\u201d of the plant is a very interesting way to keep investigating natural and not conventional uses of energy..

Also I had added a \u201cfield notes\u201d part, because I like to write notes of everything that I see, classes, talks, conversations, Ideas. Its comfortable to have that Pages visually in the design space, also is material to share with my classmates.

My Magic machine: \u00b6 The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one. Also the machine is kind of a mask in a way, because it shows the desire of creativity and joy but not in a total transparent way, so also would be great if the machine could be more transparent showing not only what I want to show the world who I am,but the whole spectrum of personality, and that should be great to show in its functionality. Group Machines: In the conversation/reflection that we had as a group, one of the main comments were that almost all the machines that we made, were to make an statement, more than reflecting us as individuals, they were for showing something to someone else, not just for us. For example Didacs machine, the one with the brick at the bottom, was to show in a methaphorical way, when justice is reached, it a good chance to new ideas or oportunities, so it will turn on a light, when the balance is reached. Another observation that we made as a group was that at the same time, we aim to things that are right, or things that make possitive ways to funtion and for others, rather than random ideas. One thing that i learned is how the materiality of objects, can lead to different interpretations of reality and can make people to connect with very deep and abstract ideas, making this exersice a great vehicle for creativity and connection with our selfs, and our thoughts and emotions in the context that we are or in a context that we want to be. THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE / 1PP \u00b6 Concepts: \u00b6 -Auto ethnography -Radical thinking -Change yourself -Extreme situations -Design Intervention https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDu9yRFaVko I started with the Question, Can be the Music a potential \u201cenergy\u201d to materialize something? Recomendation from teachers: Keep it close, do a lot of experiments, \u201csee what happens\u201d, the restriction: Had to be music made by me, not others. A guide to successfull Auto Ethnography \u00b6 Define Study Boundaries: \u00b6 My limits were determined principaly by the question I made, It was the starting point, but open to changes, The main thing was the direction, that was to materialize something with/by music. Maybe some boundarie was the time (a day) and the place, because I determine that the place should be my work/music room, using thingsthat I allready had in that specific time and place. Authenticity: \u00b6 At first, when I begun the experiment, It felt not that authentic, because I had seen a lot of this before, on social network, or youtube. The next step was way more authentic(musical shaving) because my brain allready was on a mood of doing something different, and different conection with things that normally wouldnt be connected on this subject, for example grabbing my facial hair and pur it on a music pentagram, to make \u201cmusic notes\u201d, and that was very inspiring for grabing an instrument and start creating music. Plausibility \u00b6 It relates with my personal interests ( Music and fabrication) and how I made them to work toghether. Also I think that I can add more value, exploring creativity from these areas and join points that I had never thinked before, like music and fabrication. Criticality \u00b6 This projects gathers very technical and abstract concepts. The 1PP exersice put me on a very different starting point, from beng too methodogical, to start creating from a very fast and plastic state of mind, The mindset from the initial question, kept me motivated to make things different than usual. Self reavealing comunication. (honesty) \u00b6 My project was made under a stream of consciousnes, so I think that was also very honest made. Using no filters to each activity. The thing that I missed, was to show my emotions and thoughts in the video, because in every discovery, I was a very exited, where I knew that the emotions had a lot to give. Maybe the documentation is sometimes an obstacle to work freely. Ethnographic material with confesional content. \u00b6 For this experiment, I made very personal actions, like playing guitar in my house. The video itself was not that confetional, because the actions were guided through a secuencial time. Maybe the most personal thing is that the subjects that I worked, are very related to my passions. Generalizability \u00b6 The Idea of manufacture with music, can be very interesting for other musicians, designers, scientist, sound engeneers, etc. It is in a very initial stage, but it can be extrapolated into a different area and context, to give and involve more meaning for others. I totally would use these exersise in the future, for different tasks. What happen when I envolved myself / as an instrument? \u00b6 I enyoed this process in a very insightfull way, it was like entering in a totally diferent state of mind with no stops, also with a lot of emotions happening at the same time. I felt also that this exersise was the push that I needed to start a project from a totally different aproach, from this vulnerable position from myself. Did anything change about the way of working? \u00b6 It was kind of revealing to work in this way, It allowed me to move faster into the challenges in a much more creative way and with less constrains, Also it makes the process very enjoyable, personal and intense. Coments about my colective videos \u00b6 I feel very inspired by the work of my collective, at first it was difficult to find similarities, but after analizing and speaking with my classmates, we find that the concepts behind each video, had a lot of crossing concepts viewed from different perspcetives, but with the same goal, or the same intention.","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#week-5","text":"","title":"Week 5"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Kristina Anderson Oscar Tomico Myself Drawing in a minute:","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#_1","text":"I picture myself as a very big guy with a pencil in a hand, and a guitar for making music, also with open arms reminding me that I have to be open to new ideas, also in a forest, because i allways like to be arround nature.","title":""},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#my-magic-machine","text":"The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one.
