I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program.

How to grow almost anything thrills me to encourage the future of fabrication in a very interesting way. Looking how nature build its all structures and different kind of things, It is a bit difficult to relate to my fight that looks more with a social aproach, but I think one of the oportunities is to find the link betweeen this areas. STATE OF THE ART THINGS THAT I HAD GROWN A BETTER FUTURE MY ACTUAL INTEREST Also Im very interested in this specific subjects: -Biofabrication -Metamaterials -Self assembly objects -Bio sensors -Low energy objects. -Ai/ Machine learning Multi scalar diagram My multiscalar diagram, is mainly my questions that appeared by thinking the opportunity of working with nature in very different ways, After, I arranged it into different scales to be new starting points from the scale that the questions are. 2. Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. The Atlas of weak signals is a very interesting tool that helps to connect subjects and extreme postures, aslo appearing a lot of new subjects that surprised me because I had never heard about them, so is interesting as well to see the diversity of areas that we can investigate and work. Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities. Screenshots of your collaborative design space How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? Next steps - Based on the work this week please tell me: Someone you would like to contact For this investigation I will contact a lot of people from different networks, and places: Chile: Bruno Grossi-Biologist Phd in Biomimetics Biolab UC- Work and reaserch in biomaterials Carolina Pacheco- Works in Cal.careo, growing things and structures in calcium carbonate.

My Magic machine: \u00b6 The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one. Also the machine is kind of a mask in a way, because it shows the desire of creativity and joy but not in a total transparent way, so also would be great if the machine could be more transparent showing not only what I want to show the world who I am,but the whole spectrum of personality, and that should be great to show in its functionality. Group Machines: In the conversation/reflection that we had as a group, one of the main comments were that almost all the machines that we made, were to make an statement, more than reflecting us as individuals, they were for showing something to someone else, not just for us. For example Didacs machine, the one with the brick at the bottom, was to show in a methaphorical way, when justice is reached, it a good chance to new ideas or oportunities, so it will turn on a light, when the balance is reached. Another observation that we made as a group was that at the same time, we aim to things that are right, or things that make possitive ways to funtion and for others, rather than random ideas. One thing that i learned is how the materiality of objects, can lead to different interpretations of reality and can make people to connect with very deep and abstract ideas, making this exersice a great vehicle for creativity and connection with our selfs, and our thoughts and emotions in the context that we are or in a context that we want to be.

Recomendation from teachers: Keep it close, do a lot of experiments, \u201csee what happens\u201d, the restriction: Had to be music made by me, not others. A guide to successfull Auto Ethnography \u00b6 Define Study Boundaries: My limits were determined principaly by the question I made, It was the starting point, but open to changes, The main thing was the direction, that was to materialize something with/by music. Maybe some boundarie was the time (a day) and the place, because I determine that the place should be my work/music room, using thingsthat I allready had in that specific time and place. Authenticity: At first, when I begun the experiment, It felt not that authentic, because I had seen a lot of this before, on social network, or youtube. The next step was way more authentic(musical shaving) because my brain allready was on a mood of doing something different, and different conection with things that normally wouldnt be connected on this subject, for example grabbing my facial hair and pur it on a music pentagram, to make \u201cmusic notes\u201d, and that was very inspiring for grabing an instrument and start creating music. Plausibility It relates with my personal interests ( Music and fabrication) and how I made them to work toghether. Also I think that I can add more value, exploring creativity from these areas and join points that I had never thinked before, like music and fabrication. Criticality This projects gathers very technical and abstract concepts. The 1PP exersice put me on a very different starting point, from beng too methodogical, to start creating from a very fast and plastic state of mind, The mindset from the initial question, kept me motivated to make things different than usual. Self reavealing comunication. (honesty) My project was made under a stream of consciousnes, so I think that was also very honest made. Using no filters to each activity. The thing that I missed, was to show my emotions and thoughts in the video, because in every discovery, I was a very exited, where I knew that the emotions had a lot to give. Maybe the documentation is sometimes an obstacle to work freely. Ethnographic material with confesional content. For this experiment, I made very personal actions, like playing guitar in my house. The video itself was not that confetional, because the actions were guided through a secuencial time. Maybe the most personal thing is that the subjects that I worked, are very related to my passions. Generalizability The Idea of manufacture with music, can be very interesting for other musicians, designers, scientist, sound engeneers, etc. It is in a very initial stage, but it can be extrapolated into a different area and context, to give and involve more meaning for others. I totally would use these exersise in the future, for different tasks. What happen when I envolved myself / as an instrument? \u00b6 I enyoed this process in a very insightfull way, it was like entering in a totally diferent state of mind with no stops, also with a lot of emotions happening at the same time. I felt also that this exersise was the push that I needed to start a project from a totally different aproach, from this vulnerable position from myself. Did anything change about the way of working? \u00b6 It was kind of revealing to work in this way, It allowed me to move faster into the challenges in a much more creative way and with less constrains, Also it makes the process very enjoyable, personal and intense. Coments about my colective videos \u00b6 I feel very inspired by the work of my collective, at first it was difficult to find similarities, but after analizing and speaking with my classmates, we find that the concepts behind each video, had a lot of crossing concepts viewed from different perspcetives, but with the same goal, or the same intention.","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/04-%20Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Kristina Anderson Oscar Tomico Myself Drawing in a minute: I picture myself as a very big guy with a pencil in a hand, and a guitar for making music, also with open arms reminding me that I have to be open to new ideas, also in a forest, because i allways like to be arround nature.","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/04-%20Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#my-magic-machine","text":"The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one.

Experiments: 1)Grow Materials to generate something Usefull. \u00b6 Materials: \u00b6 -Salt -Water -Recipients -String -Earing Steps: \u00b6 1)Disolve salt in warm water(80 \u00b0C aprox). 2)Revolve till the salt doesnt disolve any more. 3)Pour the mix in a transparent bowl 4) Hang the earing in water 5) Wait few days Process: \u00b6 2)Make an action that normally you will use an object to acomplish, with the minimum resources. \u00b6 Materials: -Water Tools: -Hands Steps: \u00b6 1) Open your hands with your fingers togheter. 2) Put both curved hands in your fronthead and hold both hands very tight. 3) Slowly dive into the water 4) Observe below the water. 3)Using natures energy to create something \u00b6 Materials: 1-Carnivore Plant. 2-Arduino with led program. 3-Aluminum foil. Steps: \u00b6 1) Program arduino to blink a led. 2) Make connections and open the circuit. 3) cut two strips of alufoil, and connect to the open circuit in one side, and the other side to the plant, make sure that the strips will connect when the leaves close. 4) wait till the leaf is close, the aluminum will touch and will turn on the led.
