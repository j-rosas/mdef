The most difficulty was to callibrate the sensor for different levels of light during the ambient variations. \u00b6 As we wanted to use the recycled dc motor, we had to use relays, to enable the arduino to controll the dc motor to move to both sides. Also because the motor was too big for the usb power or the arduino power, so the relays acted as a AC/DC convertor. \u00b6 We also use almost recycled parts for building the robot, the body was from some used parts from fablab, we designedthe vertical post to make space for the motor. then we added the electronics to the body. \u00b6 The mirror was taken from a hard drive, and the IR sensors were attached to the center of the mirror with a wooden circular piece. \u00b6 We also 3d print two pieces to atach the dc motor to the structure, and the black cilinder to grab the motor movement, to rotate de disk. \u00b6 The arduino ESP32 was attached to a breadboard, a very tough solution, but for the purpose of the machine, was enough for the function of the robot. We also put black tape to the wires to ensure that the cables doesnt tangle with the robots movement. \u00b6 Reflection: \u00b6 Recicling parts: We added to our challenge to use only recycled parts for electronics mostly, it was a challenge because we had to use more complex electronics, like relays, to make the motor run both ways, that could be done much more easier with a servo motor but the challenge to use a recycled part, strech our limits to make it work. \u00b6 Programming: It was very interesting that we build our groups by our capacities, so I had added me because of my fabrication skills, but I wanted to learn arduino and programming, I challenge myself to make the motor and the sensor work. then it was a teamwork to program and understand the function of the whole system. \u00b6 Teamwork: It was very interesting to build the group with different capacities and interest, we saw that capacities fully proved during the process, we aimed to distribute the work by fabrication, programing, electronics testing, and documenting.finnally we ended doing different tasks by everyone, and also at different points, we presented explaining each other what we were doing at the time. \u00b6 Doing something Useless: I realize that is very difficult to do something \u201cuseless\u201d, because as designers, we are used to create something for a user, or someone else, but allways usefull. \u00b6 Documentation: We made a 1 min video, that reflects very well the concept of the robot, showing its function, and reflecting the \u201cuselessnes\u201d of it. The blue background used for video recording, gives also a profesionalism to the class videos. \u00b6 Its a very good way to document something that its going to be disasembled for shure to be reused to build more robots. \u00b6","title":"Almost Useless machines"},{"location":"seminars/Almost%20Useless%20machines/#week-7","text":"","title":"Week 7"},{"location":"seminars/Almost%20Useless%20machines/#almost-useless-machines","text":"","title":"Almost useless Machines"},{"location":"seminars/Almost%20Useless%20machines/#process","text":"","title":"Process"},{"location":"seminars/Almost%20Useless%20machines/#triying-the-dc-motor-from-the-roomba-brushes-in-the-back-the-power-source-let-us-try-different-levels-of-voltages-for-managing-the-movement-that-we-needed-for-the-robot","text":"","title":"Triying the DC motor from the roomba brushes, in the back, the power source let us try different levels of voltages for managing the movement that we needed for the robot."},{"location":"seminars/Almost%20Useless%20machines/#testing-the-roomba-ir-sensor-with-arduino-the-most-difficulty-was-to-callibrate-the-sensor-for-different-levels-of-light-during-the-ambient-variations","text":"","title":"Testing the roomba IR sensor with arduino.

Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. \u00b6 The Atlas of weak signals is a very interesting tool that helps to connect subjects and extreme postures, aslo appearing a lot of new subjects that surprised me because I had never heard about them, so is interesting as well to see the diversity of areas that we can investigate and work. Also i think that is avery efficient tool to use as a community that we are as a master course. In a moment i saw like 20 people thinking and acctually working in one subject, bringing the collective thinking to the learning experience, and the results were amazing, looking for things that never will ocurred to me because im a singular organism with boundaries.I believe that the Atlas helps also to create more weak signals and opportunnities with different organizations and communities. \u00b6 3.

How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? \u00b6 In the collserolla Trip, we had a very good time talking beetween classmates, and there we had to take with us only one weak signal, so that make us decide and talk to each other about our choices. That was very interesting because we share opinions, previous projects that we knew, and knowledge about every subject.

The interesting thing about this new process, Is that they propose a new way to extract sik without killing the worms, by letting them to wove their cocoons, and at the same time, evolve into the next stage of the larva. \u00b6 I picked this paper to understand in an specific way, how this ingestigation started, how the probes were made, to understand how is possible to work with this organic systems and to create new ways of manufacture. \u00b6 Sumary 3d printing vs natural fabrication \u00b6 3D printing traditional methods, are very funtional in a way, but it is not as efficient as natural fabrication, like spider webs, birds nests, or worm silk, wich contruction is organic and high efficient, ussing the less resource ass posible, working in an incredible way, so that statement opens a new investigation direction, where the natural procesess inspired humands, to develop new methods of manufacture. \u00b6 Fiber orientation \u00b6 \u201cUsing additive manu- facturing technologies are much less sustainable: from a material perspective - homogeneous materi- als offer less potential for structural optimization; and from a fabrication perspective - additive manu- factured components are constructed in layers, rely- ing on the deposition of significant amounts of wasted support material\u201d \u00b6 The fiber construction method is very effective, because it uses a high resistant material, to the purpose of protecting the cocoon, till it reaches its evolving stage, the puppa. One cocoon has more than a kilometer long, and its deposited in the most efficient way. \u00b6 About silk \u00b6 Silk is an amazing material, its one of the most high ended, exensive and old materials recolected by humans, its used to make clothes, fibers, and its used in textile industry and medicine. The silk as a material also has a binder, the cericin.The worm makes the cocoon using its own environment attaching the silk into different points. \u00b6 Motion tracking \u00b6 In the reaserch, they installed a worm into a acrilic box, and they used different of cameras to analyse how many points of contact were used by the worm to make the sik structure, concluding that they were more than 1.000.000 points of contact. that motion track, encouraged the team to speculate about a robotic process of fabrication. \u00b6 Fiber based robot simulating construction \u00b6 Using a Kuka robot, they manage to install a headset to the robotic arm, that deposit HDPE, a termoplastic that can be used for 3d printing. Also they conclude that changing the extrude power and speed of the headset, would be possible to vary in density, thikness and quality of the material. Also they simulated the contact points with hook on the wall, enabling the robotig arm to create HDPE structures based on the silk worm funtion. \u00b6 Images: Making a mutant The drought has been a issue from long time ago, but now we can see its impact in a lot of scenes. In Chile, The desertification its happening rigth know, and its effects are vissible to the eye. \u201cAculeo\u201d lagoon was a balneary 30 min far from Santiago, where families have houses arround the lake, and ussually go for the weekend to swim and make watersports. Today that lagoon is a desert field of dry land, where horses and cows eat grass. \u00b6 There are some local inventions to battle the drought, One is called \u201cfresh water\u201d. Its a home machine that literaly takes water from the air and transform it to drinkable water. That process is very interesting, and it has been used for little comunities that have no acces to potable water. \u00b6 This kind pf project are very nice inventions, but to make that proceses, they use a lot of energy, electricity, and resources to be constructed. Other iniciatives, are the recollectors of morning humidity in the coast, called \u201ccamanchaca\u201d. They are inspired in plants or grass, that recollect the morning fog\u00b4s water to hidratate the plant or soil. Its the same Idea, but with a horizontal net that gathers drops of water to acumulate it to pipes or more bigger water containers, so we are literally getting water from humidity. \u00b6 My idea of gene mutation is inspired by human made water recolection systems, and some nature systems, like the Namib desert beetle, that use its legs to recollect or harvest water from the fog in the air. \u00b6 There is an impressive reptile, that has the possibillity to control its temperature form external factors. The Leatherback turte. \u00b6 \u201cLeatherback sea turtles are so successful at regulating their body temperature that they have the ability to maintain constant body temperature 18 degrees above or below the ambient temperature. That is so incredible that some researchers argue because this process is metabolically accomplished leatherback sea turtles are actually endothermic. However, this process is not anatomically conducted, therefore most researchers suggest this is a diminutive version of endothermy at best.\u201d \u00b6 Would be possible to modificate humans genes, to give the biological cappacity to obtain and hydratate with the water from the environment? \u00b6 Looking to igem.org tools and projects, I havent found anything like this kind pfo project, As we talked in class, CrispCas-9 should be a possible way to edit or modify human DNA, specifically the generation of cells that help us regulate our inner temperature system. \u00b6 https://www.science.org/content/article/could-desert-beetle-help-humans-harvest-water-thin-air https://oceanadventures.co.za/animals-regulate-body-temperature/ https://oceanfdn.org/the-thermoregulating-ectotherm/ Reflection This set of lectures, were very interesting and inspiring because from the biology point of view, my interest in grow almost anything, has to do a lot. Also for me, is necesarry to know the basics of biology, if im going to work with biofabrication, biomaterials and living organisms. I also would be using a lot my toolbox network, to contact profesionals if I have more doubts about biology. \u00b6 The only comment that I would do to Nuria is that in some parts, the concepts were too \u201cscientific\u201d, so I get lost sometimes in the terminology, but with a bit of asking and time, I was able to understand the main concepts. \u00b6 Also all the practical area in both Bio / Agri, were very insightfull, because we were able to see how a lot of things work, like how to grow bacterias, or how to work in a sterile environment. That are totally usefull things that I will be useing for shure along the master. \u00b6 For de Agri Zero week, I found that im much more interested and related to the conuntryside that I was aware. All my youth I used to lived in the countryside of Curic\u00f3, a city in the middle south of Chile, famous for its Vineyards and fields for agriculture. Also my both parents are agronomists, so I had been related to the field mostly all my life. I find very interesting to use Barcelona as a natural laboratory. we have a big opportunity to work with nature here, and take advantage of Valldaura labs as well, if we need some countryside help or inspiration \u00b6","title":"Biology Agri Zero"},{"location":"seminars/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#week-3-4","text":"","title":"Week 3-4"},{"location":"seminars/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#bio_agri_zero","text":"Teachers: Jonathan Minchin Nuria Conde Grow your own Bacteria","title":"BIO_AGRI_ZERO"},{"location":"seminars/Biology_Agri%20Zero/#for-this-activity-we-manage-to-grow-a-bacteria-from-residues-in-iaacs-environment-for-the-sample-i-took-pidgeon-poop-that-was-outside-iaac-at-the-bicycle-parking-the-dark-spots-are-different-kind-of-fungus-that-had-appeared-on-the-agar-agar-base","text":"","title":"For this activity we manage to grow a bacteria from residues in iaacs environment, for the sample, I took pidgeon poop, that was outside Iaac, at the bicycle parking.

I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. \u00b6 The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. \u00b6 In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. \u00b6 Poster: Some of my actual questions are: Research: \u00b6 -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. \u00b6 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future \u00b6 My poster reflects how the future should be, in my perspective, there has to be people \u201cjoining the dots\u201d, unifying the creative aspects and profesions, with citizens and people, as Victor Papanek said, Design can be a very well use tool, or the most dangerous carreer of all. The main thing is that design can change realities, points of view, and the most important, can improve peoples lifes. \u00b6 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. \u00b6 My Identity is very powerfull as a designer itself, from a long time ago, I started designing even before start going to Design school, Almost every Sunday, I tried to create something interesting and usefull. My skills are maily from building things, related to design, crafts and arts, to beaing an easy learner in some aspects, I have to recognize that electronics and programming are a bit difficult for me to learn. \u00b6 Related to my attitude, I feel like a very positive person, allways trying to go for the bright side, aalso trying to be a fresh person, related to people, and new knowledge that is arround. Also Im very Open and confident about the things that I do, and im very bad to say No to challenges. \u00b6 My knowledge goes mainly in creative ways, like design, arts, materials, methodologies, etc. I find myself like a \u201d sea of 1mm of depth\u201d because I love to learn and do a lot but mainly with no depth in everything \u00b6 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude \u00b6 With the meetings I had found that I had been atracted to lear programming and coding as some classmates, but it allways goes to nothing, because I don\u00b4t keep practising it, and when I had the chance, in FabLab U. de Chile, I had been \u201csafe\u201d in my own knowledge and tasks. So thats a very interesting challenge for me. \u00b6 Also im beginning to interest in new subjects, as AI, VR, and Biology. 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity \u00b6 My new professional Identity, would be like an digital fabrication designer + Technological tools, like programming and the use of electronics in projects. I would love to learn more about it in \u201cTech beyond myth\u201d \u00b6 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). \u00b6 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program. \u00b6 I had made a circular draft for the first term, because I think that the 1st term process is circular, not returning to zero, but to gain the experience of the courses and become a \u201cnew me\u201d with all the new knowledge and experiences. \u00b6 Week 1 Asignature :MDEF Bootcamp Skills :Use of workshop tools, get use to iaac space, Learn git, and web programming Knowledge : design theory, new concepts of design, new learning process, working adaptation.

Reflect on your own RtD toolbox based on \u201cyour new me\u201d and create a \u201cnew workspace\u201d. I had created a new workspace based on my new investigation subject, I started with the subject \u201d How to grow almost anything\u201d, but its interesting how the subject starts to grow itself. \u00b6 My new workspace have new areas, like an instagram page, where im collecting all of the \u201cgrowed\u201d things that I find dalyly, like parrots nest on a light tower, or furballs made by peoples hair in transtation, thats a very nice activity to do because it feeds the workspace almost everyday with things that I see everyday. \u00b6 Also I had added a \u201cfield notes\u201d part, because I like to write notes of everything that I see, classes, talks, conversations, Ideas. Its comfortable to have that Pages visually in the design space, also is material to share with my classmates. \u00b6 Im adding as well state of the art projects, to see what can I learn from them, and what its missing in that state, Would be great to found some new ways in the field. \u00b6 I had notice that my studio relates to two main fields, materials and energy, so I will focus my project In that direction. I will make profund observation of this subjects in the process of the master. \u00b6 2. Select the main roles of prototyping and other design activities that you want to use based on the context you are in (onion mapping from the Atlas) and add them to your design space. My way of prototiping, at the moment has been near to different Roles, at first I thought that my process was accumulative, going deeper into the \u201cgrow\u201d subject, but I have realised that the concept is more abstract, that only grow biological things, so It has been a mix of comparative, and probing as well. \u00b6 3. Do your first design experiment applying one or different roles of prototyping. Experiments: Details of the experiments are in the \u201cProject\u201d tab. Grow Materials to generate something Usefull. The first experiment starts from the question of \u201cCan I add value to some existing object, growing something into it? \u00b6 The first experiment was to grow salt cristals in an earing, showing in a simple way, that a growed system can add value to a simple object as an earing. Also in terms of time, jewellery is very acord because the salt don\u00b4t need that much time to grow in it. \u00b6 2)Make an action that normally you will use an object to acomplish, with the minimum resources. I had saw that technique in youtube, to see underwater only with my hands, I do it all the time when I dont have my snorkelling googles. This experiment has amazed me because the concept of useing nothing but your body to make a task, is something that we don\u00b4t question that much in our normal lifes, we allways think that we need \u201csomething\u201d to archieve our goals, for example if we teach our children to do this technique, we are avoiding buying that cheap snorkeling googles that are selled on the beach, used once and thtown away, because they were broken, bad quality, or the kid wasnt interested anymore. \u00b6 3)Using natures energy to create something The third one aims to use the mechanical energy of living organisms to enable them to comunicate with humans when they move.(output) \u00b6 For this project I had used the energy of the Carnivore plant, so when it picked a bug or a fly, it will move and let me know when it catches something. For the experiment I had attached to aluminum foil, because of the weight, to each leaf of the plant, and the foil were connected to an arduino with the Led program, so the foils were the \u201ccircuit cut\u201d, and when they get togheter, they turn the Led On. This project made me wonder a lot of questions, for example how would be to work with nature, and not nature work for you, also the moving \u201cenergy\u201d of the plant is a very interesting way to keep investigating natural and not conventional uses of energy.. \u00b6 New Toolbox Position ourselves in the Design space and make a reflection. Week 5 A reflection on how you are documenting and communicating your work At the moment, The documentation process, has been a constant auto learning process, as we use the design space, github, and web platforms, Its neccesary to make a \u201croutine\u201d to make the documenting, more efficient. \u00b6 Allways my documentation process starts from writing and drawing on my notebook, because Its faster, and more memorable for me. \u00b6 My second tool is my cellphone, for pictures, video and audio recording, makes easier to gather info, to make gifs or photo edition. \u00b6 With the phone, One app is Instagram, I have made an instagram called Grow your things lab, where I upload and share daily Discoveries or observations on the \u201cgrow\u201d concept. \u00b6 Another app that I use a lot is \u201cArduino Science Journal\u201d, Is very good because its possible to use the sensors of the phone to make experiments, also works like a science journal to take pictures and write on them. \u00b6 Then the final step is uploading everything to github webpage and miro design space. The good thing of git, is that anybody can enter and take anything from the webpage. \u00b6 3 min Video aprox wich can include multiple ways of video journaling documenting the course tech beyond myth. (EXPERIMENT!!) Week 9 Documenting Tech beyond myth \u00b6 The goal of the documentation was to record audios from the teachers in their lectures, gathering the most interesting words and phrases, and manage to put them all in a certain order to make a beat from the better parts of the course. \u00b6 The second part was to gather one word from each classmate to get what they got from the course, from learnings to feelings. \u00b6 The hardwarte used was a OP-1 Sintetizer, a zoom recorder, iphone for audios. \u00b6 The software used was logic pro, illustrator, and imovie. \u00b6 A reflection that i had is that the mic recorder is a very complementary tool for lectures because if its used properly, it is very low sized in memory, and its very accesible and hearable, like a podcast or something similar. I have a good auditive memory, so this tool complements very well with the sketchbook where I write and draw all the time. \u00b6","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"seminars/Design%20Studio/#week-11","text":"","title":"Week 11"},{"location":"seminars/Design%20Studio/#design-studio","text":"Teachers: Oscar Tomico Tom\u00e1s Vivanco 1.

An Exploration of Inter-Species Collaboration For the final Design Dialogues event at the end of term 1, Joaquin, Didac and Chris teamed up for the accompanying design intervention. We are interested in the intersection between music, collaborative jamming, nature and how these things can be combined. We wanted to research how engaging in an intimate collaborative setting with plants could foster a meaningful inter-species connections. For that, we decided to enable a inter-species jam session, where the plants would be both musicians and instruments. Below, our conceptual ideas and project planning can be found, as well as some first sketches for the final project artifact. \u00b6 Building a Prototype With the help of the MakeyMakey, some plants from the Fab Lab office (thank you!) and Ableton Live, we managed to get a first minimal viable product for a few classmates to test out. See some of the impressions below: \u00b6 First Insights We managed to extract some interesting insights from these experiments. First of all, it was intriguing to see how the sounds produced did not only dramatically change the perception of the users towards this plant, but also the interaction that comes with it. From slight touching and caressing to pinching and hitting the plant, a wide range of interactions could be observed just by linking different sounds to the individual plants. Secondly, the perception of the experiment as a whole changed according to what musical mood we were aiming for: There proved to be a much different vibe between mysterious, atmospheric synthesizer and bell chimes samples on the one hand and some pulsing electronic lead synths on the other hand \u2013 while one made our test users connect to the plant on a emotional level, the driving electronic rhythms resonated with our test subjects on a more physical level. This first experiment clearly illustrates why sample selection is an incredibly integral part of the intervention, because it profoundly shapes both interaction with and perception of the plants. \u00b6 Preparation For the preparation of the intervention we split the work between the tree of us, each taking charge of a different component of the final product. That meant figuring out the electronics, designing and building the plant boxes and doing the sound design for the plants. Below, you can find some images documenting our progress towards the final result. \u00b6 The Intervention On the day of our intervention, which was Sunday, 12 Dec, we were blessed with a beautiful weather and a calm Sunday noon vibe in Parc de la Cuitadella, where a lot of families went for a walk. Already while setting up, people stopped and asked to interact with the plants. We\u2019ll let the images below speak for themselves. \u00b6 Reflections on the Intervention The response to our intervention was overwhelming and for all of us everything but anticipated. As it can be seen in the pictures and the video above, we were fortunate to witness some very special moments of intimate interactions between passersby and plants to make music together. Especially children were absolutely enchanted by the concept of singing plants and were the most fearless when it came to interacting with the plants. Often, adults would be shy at first \u2013 but after inviting them in to join, they usually lost their initial hesitancy. Throughout all ages and genders, people were amazed by this way of interacting with plants, which was new for almost all of them. \u00b6 People touched the plants softly, with respect, caressing them to test out the different sounds. Quickly, people understood the basic logic of the setup and how a circuit was closed to trigger the sounds. From there, it often took just a single comment about the conductivity of the human skin in order to start people holding hands while making music. By doing that, they were able to multiply the amount of touch points with the plants and through that, were able to create much more complex soundscapes. These were the moments when we were sure to have enabled a rare moment of collaboration, not just between people but between two species. \u00b6 The sounds the plants made were not fixed \u2013 rather, they were changing constantly as we were trying to evolve the music piece that was collectively composed: Changing from major to minor scales, modulating tempo, drum patterns and chords as well as giving people more percussive or atmospheric sounds to play with. This influenced the interactions with the plants in a very profound way, since the sound each plant made was somehow understood as its \u2018voice\u2019, thus shaping the perception of its character. Through experimentation and iteration with the sounds, we began to understand what worked best in the context of this public performance. A looped drum pattern was integral to giving the collective jam session a rhythmic backbone and was necessary in order to draw people in to interact. On top of that, atmospheric and layered sounds in harmonic chords and re-triggering patterns proved to be among the most accessible samples to make music with in this particular setup, with this particular crowd of participants. Further inquiry into the sound design is needed. \u00b6 Many people asked about our social media profiles and/or personal contact details, which underlined the need for a good online presence (beyond this website) as well as the potential for professionalizing this intervention as a live performance. We declined any money offered to us by the intervention participants. \u00b6 Reflecting on the intervention with some distance, our most important goal was achieved, which was placing plants front and center in the interactions. In our experiment they were the integral part, to which the other components, music and technology, connected. This sparked many interesting conversations, which revolved around connecting to plants, how plants perceive touch, how plants react to the music we play and how plants feel in a profound way. Using music as a vehicle for creating empathy for other organisms to inspire inter-species collaboration proves to be a promising idea. \u00b6 Future Possibilities As far as the next steps of this project are concerned, there is a lot more to discover. The most immediate impulse was, of course, to frame this more as a curated live performance, which can be played in a music venue or club. This also begs for exploring the potentials of an integrated A/V show including generatively produced visuals accompanying the performance. This should be feasible and fairly easy to implement through connecting Ableton with Notch or Touchdesigner (thank you for pointing that out Tatjana!). \u00b6 The other interesting conceptual avenue to go down would be, instead of bringing plants to the city in artificial and highly curated environments, to bring the people to the nature to be embedded in the environment the plants originate from. This would enable us to facilitate more spontaneous and less curated interactions with the plants that are found there, to use music to improvise and to meditate with the ecosystem there. Conceptually, this is a very interesting approach to take with this experiment, which is to be regarded the polar opposite of the curated live show described in the paragraph above. \u00b6 All the information of our design intervention, observations and reflections, are in this link: https://plant-b.io","title":"Design intervention"},{"location":"seminars/Design%20intervention/#week-11","text":"PLANT B PLANT B INTERVENTION from D\u00eddac Torrent on Vimeo .

These were the moments when we were sure to have enabled a rare moment of collaboration, not just between people but between two species."},{"location":"seminars/Design%20intervention/#the-sounds-the-plants-made-were-not-fixed-rather-they-were-changing-constantly-as-we-were-trying-to-evolve-the-music-piece-that-was-collectively-composed-changing-from-major-to-minor-scales-modulating-tempo-drum-patterns-and-chords-as-well-as-giving-people-more-percussive-or-atmospheric-sounds-to-play-with-this-influenced-the-interactions-with-the-plants-in-a-very-profound-way-since-the-sound-each-plant-made-was-somehow-understood-as-its-voice-thus-shaping-the-perception-of-its-character-through-experimentation-and-iteration-with-the-sounds-we-began-to-understand-what-worked-best-in-the-context-of-this-public-performance-a-looped-drum-pattern-was-integral-to-giving-the-collective-jam-session-a-rhythmic-backbone-and-was-necessary-in-order-to-draw-people-in-to-interact-on-top-of-that-atmospheric-and-layered-sounds-in-harmonic-chords-and-re-triggering-patterns-proved-to-be-among-the-most-accessible-samples-to-make-music-with-in-this-particular-setup-with-this-particular-crowd-of-participants-further-inquiry-into-the-sound-design-is-needed","text":"","title":"The sounds the plants made were not fixed \u2013 rather, they were changing constantly as we were trying to evolve the music piece that was collectively composed: Changing from major to minor scales, modulating tempo, drum patterns and chords as well as giving people more percussive or atmospheric sounds to play with. This influenced the interactions with the plants in a very profound way, since the sound each plant made was somehow understood as its 'voice', thus shaping the perception of its character. Through experimentation and iteration with the sounds, we began to understand what worked best in the context of this public performance. A looped drum pattern was integral to giving the collective jam session a rhythmic backbone and was necessary in order to draw people in to interact. On top of that, atmospheric and layered sounds in harmonic chords and re-triggering patterns proved to be among the most accessible samples to make music with in this particular setup, with this particular crowd of participants. Further inquiry into the sound design is needed."},{"location":"seminars/Design%20intervention/#many-people-asked-about-our-social-media-profiles-andor-personal-contact-details-which-underlined-the-need-for-a-good-online-presence-beyond-this-website-as-well-as-the-potential-for-professionalizing-this-intervention-as-a-live-performance-we-declined-any-money-offered-to-us-by-the-intervention-participants","text":"","title":"Many people asked about our social media profiles and/or personal contact details, which underlined the need for a good online presence (beyond this website) as well as the potential for professionalizing this intervention as a live performance.

For example Didacs machine, the one with the brick at the bottom, was to show in a methaphorical way, when justice is reached, it a good chance to new ideas or oportunities, so it will turn on a light, when the balance is reached. \u00b6 Another observation that we made as a group was that at the same time, we aim to things that are right, or things that make possitive ways to funtion and for others, rather than random ideas. \u00b6 One thing that i learned is how the materiality of objects, can lead to different interpretations of reality and can make people to connect with very deep and abstract ideas, making this exersice a great vehicle for creativity and connection with our selfs, and our thoughts and emotions in the context that we are or in a context that we want to be. \u00b6 THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE / 1PP \u00b6 Concepts: \u00b6 -Auto ethnography -Radical thinking -Change yourself -Extreme situations -Design Intervention https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDu9yRFaVko I started with the Question, Can be the Music a potential \u201cenergy\u201d to materialize something? \u00b6 Recomendation from teachers: Keep it close, do a lot of experiments, \u201csee what happens\u201d, the restriction: Had to be music made by me, not others. \u00b6 From the magical machines exersice, I had realized that I allways persue music as a creative way to build something, as a non profesional musician, Im allways trying to mix music with my projects. So in this case, I started doing a musical breakfast, so I recorded every step of making a normal breakfast and then I manage to edit it in different ways in Logic pro,A music composer software. At first I joined all the sounds to sound at the same time, then I arranged it in a random order to see what would happen, then I ordered the sounds in a logical way to make them more pleasant to the ear. the result was very tipical so I moved forward. then I took the shaving machine, and started to shave myself in a musical rythm, then I realized that the hairs of my face, were like little dots in a pentagram, so I manage to order those hairs in a musical pentagram, and that action lead me to pick my guitar and play somethig inspired from that action. When I reached my guitar I htried different ways the musical amp make noise and energy, I realized that the bass notes were powerfull and moved more air compared to the treble, so I realized that I can puth thing to see that movenment of the speaker. then I moved forward adding a white paper and different types of dust, to see how it would change with different bass notes. Finally I manage to solidify the dust with some glue, at the same time that the speaker was moving, so I had created a unique shape mixing the material and the energy, with that result, I had answered my question, with a very promisin direction. \u00b6 via GIPHY A guide to successfull Auto Ethnography \u00b6 Define Study Boundaries: \u00b6 My limits were determined principaly by the question I made, It was the starting point, but open to changes, The main thing was the direction, that was to materialize something with/by music. Maybe some boundarie was the time (a day) and the place, because I determine that the place should be my work/music room, using thingsthat I allready had in that specific time and place. \u00b6 Authenticity: \u00b6 At first, when I begun the experiment, It felt not that authentic, because I had seen a lot of this before, on social network, or youtube. The next step was way more authentic(musical shaving) because my brain allready was on a mood of doing something different, and different conection with things that normally wouldnt be connected on this subject, for example grabbing my facial hair and pur it on a music pentagram, to make \u201cmusic notes\u201d, and that was very inspiring for grabing an instrument and start creating music. \u00b6 Plausibility \u00b6 It relates with my personal interests ( Music and fabrication) and how I made them to work toghether. Also I think that I can add more value, exploring creativity from these areas and join points that I had never thinked before, like music and fabrication. \u00b6 Criticality \u00b6 This projects gathers very technical and abstract concepts. The 1PP exersice put me on a very different starting point, from beng too methodogical, to start creating from a very fast and plastic state of mind, The mindset from the initial question, kept me motivated to make things different than usual. \u00b6 Self reavealing comunication. (honesty) \u00b6 My project was made under a stream of consciousnes, so I think that was also very honest made. Using no filters to each activity. The thing that I missed, was to show my emotions and thoughts in the video, because in every discovery, I was a very exited, where I knew that the emotions had a lot to give. Maybe the documentation is sometimes an obstacle to work freely. \u00b6 Ethnographic material with confesional content. \u00b6 For this experiment, I made very personal actions, like playing guitar in my house. The video itself was not that confetional, because the actions were guided through a secuencial time. Maybe the most personal thing is that the subjects that I worked, are very related to my passions. \u00b6 Generalizability \u00b6 The Idea of manufacture with music, can be very interesting for other musicians, designers, scientist, sound engeneers, etc. It is in a very initial stage, but it can be extrapolated into a different area and context, to give and involve more meaning for others. \u00b6 I totally would use these exersise in the future, for different tasks. \u00b6 What happen when I envolved myself / as an instrument? \u00b6 I enyoed this process in a very insightfull way, it was like entering in a totally diferent state of mind with no stops, also with a lot of emotions happening at the same time. I felt also that this exersise was the push that I needed to start a project from a totally different aproach, from this vulnerable position from myself. \u00b6 Did anything change about the way of working? \u00b6 It was kind of revealing to work in this way, It allowed me to move faster into the challenges in a much more creative way and with less constrains, Also it makes the process very enjoyable, personal and intense. \u00b6 Coments about my colective videos \u00b6 I feel very inspired by the work of my collective, at first it was difficult to find similarities, but after analizing and speaking with my classmates, we find that the concepts behind each video, had a lot of crossing concepts viewed from different perspcetives, but with the same goal, or the same intention. \u00b6","title":"Living with your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#week-5","text":"","title":"Week 5"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"Teachers: Kristina Anderson Oscar Tomico Angela Mackey","title":"Living With your own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#myself-drawing-in-a-minute","text":"","title":"Myself Drawing in a minute:"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#i-picture-myself-as-a-very-big-guy-with-a-pencil-in-a-hand-and-a-guitar-for-making-music-also-with-open-arms-reminding-me-that-i-have-to-be-open-to-new-ideas-also-in-a-forest-because-i-allways-like-to-be-arround-nature","text":"","title":"I picture myself as a very big guy with a pencil in a hand, and a guitar for making music, also with open arms reminding me that I have to be open to new ideas, also in a forest, because i allways like to be arround nature."},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#my-magic-machine","text":"","title":"My Magic machine:"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#the-instrument-of-random-music-is-a-magic-machine-that-plays-with-creativity-creating-music-when-the-metalic-pencil-hits-the-glass-bottle-in-a-random-way-as-talking-with-people-would-be-great-that-there-were-more-pencils-to-enable-the-instrument-to-be-colaborative-and-be-used-by-more-peole-instead-as-only-one","text":"","title":"The instrument of random music, is a magic machine that plays with creativity, creating music when the metalic pencil hits the glass bottle in a random way, as talking with people, would be great that there were more pencils to enable the instrument to be colaborative and be used by more peole, instead as only one."},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#also-the-machine-is-kind-of-a-mask-in-a-way-because-it-shows-the-desire-of-creativity-and-joy-but-not-in-a-total-transparent-way-so-also-would-be-great-if-the-machine-could-be-more-transparent-showing-not-only-what-i-want-to-show-the-world-who-i-ambut-the-whole-spectrum-of-personality-and-that-should-be-great-to-show-in-its-functionality","text":"","title":"Also the machine is kind of a mask in a way, because it shows the desire of creativity and joy but not in a total transparent way, so also would be great if the machine could be more transparent showing not only what I want to show the world who I am,but the whole spectrum of personality, and that should be great to show in its functionality."},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#group-machines","text":"","title":"Group Machines:"},{"location":"seminars/Living%20with%20your%20own%20Ideas/#in-the-conversationreflection-that-we-had-as-a-group-one-of-the-main-comments-were-that-almost-all-the-machines-that-we-made-were-to-make-an-statement-more-than-reflecting-us-as-individuals-they-were-for-showing-something-to-someone-else-not-just-for-us-for-example-didacs-machine-the-one-with-the-brick-at-the-bottom-was-to-show-in-a-methaphorical-way-when-justice-is-reached-it-a-good-chance-to-new-ideas-or-oportunities-so-it-will-turn-on-a-light-when-the-balance-is-reached","text":"","title":"In the conversation/reflection that we had as a group, one of the main comments were that almost all the machines that we made, were to make an statement, more than reflecting us as individuals, they were for showing something to someone else, not just for us.

We find out that the Robot was much more simple that we imagine, when we resume the functions, in navigation, sensors, hardware, we manage to undertand the main function of it. Then We search for different parts online, to find out what they were, and look for info. \u00b6 Roomba cleaner before dissasebmbly \u00b6 DC motor R500, we look for it in google to see how much the voltage was.then we turned it on with a power source. \u00b6 Some pieces of the roomba, wheels, DC motors, a LOT of plastics parts from the filter. \u00b6 All pieces of the dissasembled roomba. \u00b6 2021 Roomba \u00b6 A world in Data \u00b6 Actity: Find an objective, that can be very local, and can be extrapolated to new opportunities. \u00b6 https://hackmd.io/DoyUHU3PRxqc3-BeWHck3w?view Sense-Making Journal: Loneliness Among Young Adults in Barcelona \u00b6 Project Goals \u00b6 Objective Make young people feel less lonely in Barcelona \u00b6 Question Is instant messaging making young people more lonely than other generations in Barcelona? \u00b6 Hypothesis Instant messaging is making people feel lonely in Barcelona \u00b6 Tips -We think we could have been more definitive while setting the age group. \u00b6 -Linking social media usage and loneliness as an assumption and the only factor. \u00b6 -Generating our own data instead of an external source. \u00b6 The tool we used was Ardurino with LSR sensor to measure light. \u00b6 (###### foto arduino, foto sensor) We had two other options, the web scraper for collecting data about online behaviours or the physical intervention to interact with people for understanding loneliness from different perspectives. \u00b6 Now we are satisfied with the tool we used, but in the future we would add more interactions to it by using audio visual ways of collecting data. \u00b6 Tool usage documentation \u00b6 Data capturing tool set: - Ardurinio board with LDR sensors. \u00b6 Data capturing device, either laptop or a small computer device attached to the Ardurino. Installation: - Face the LDR sensors by bending to directions based on the locations of the people around the table. - Attach the machine to a piece of cardboard and attached to the bottom of the table with tape. - If the LDR sensor does not capture enough light, when the device is too far, cover the device with a diffuser paper for capturing distant light. Capturing data: Data capturing strategy \u00b6 We wanted to see with our data collection, if people use their phones for instant social interactions and messaging even when they have a company around them. \u00b6 Restaurants could be a good place for capturing this, by seeing people being together, but some of them use their phones secretly under the table, disconnecting themselves from others. We couldn\u2019t measure it in real life, because we couldn\u2019t install the device without the laptop under the table, so we observed if this is a valid case by visiting restaurants during lunch time around Poblenou. \u00b6 The findings: - When people are alone, they don\u2019t just focus on their lunch, but they interact with their phones \u00b6 When people want to use their phones in company, they do this under the table, to not show Materials needed \u00b6 arduino board jumper wires LDR light sensors (4) breadboard 10k transistors (4) usb cable to power cardboard masking tape phone Data collected \u00b6 We used a serial monitor at first to give us a visual representation of the light changes then used CSV to give us a numerical output which represents the same information in another fashion. The CSV is able to give us the tabular data to evaluate in further steps. \u00b6 We gave each sensor its own line so that theoretically, if there were multiple phones, we could see which direction the light was coming from. We could identify micro changes based on the different curve points the light intensity from differing media apps which are based on how users usually interact with and navigate them. \u00b6 Tips \u00b6 The data that was collected was only when the device was used under the table. No data was gathered when it is used above the table. The usage was calculated precisely only when the device was on full brightness mode. Dark mode might mess with the data and might miss the usage. The sensor works to its full potential only in dark environments. To connect it through internet so that we didn\u2019t have to use the wires and be restricted. Data insights \u00b6 The amount of time spent on an app can be a window into what kind of connection the user needs or desires. The sudden spike and fall of data graph represents the speed of the scrolling activity. This maybe can be an indication of the mood of the person- maybe how anxious the person is. Frequency of use- how often is the urge to use phone when already in a social situation? How often the spikes change between apps could indicate the attention span or focus of a person No phone \u00b6 Four sensors are turned on, but detecting almost no light. Instagram \u00b6 Every peak is a scroll down, at the left is a slow scrolling, in the right its a fast scrolling (Anxious people?) Whatsapp \u00b6 Photo browsing \u00b6 The flat areas show less movement in the screen. Gmail \u00b6 the interface of gmail is practically white, so there are no radical changes in the brightness. Tips \u00b6 Future steps for the experiment: Increase number of sensors across different tables Make them unattached from the computer to be more discreet(using arduino feather with wifi data transfer) Identify further connections between media app usage and loneliness Use unbiased test subjects Test in crowded, social environments Reflection I had found profoundly interesting this course, from forensics of the obsolescence to world of Data, there has been so many insights, concepts, discoveries from the teachers and us, that is necessary to order it by different areas and acttivities. \u00b6 1.Dissasembling roomba/Forensics I liked very much this activitie, because i have been disasembling things since I was a kid, so it have an emotional factor as well. We manage to disasemble by team, a roomba. Analising its parts, components, electronic hardware, etc. Also we managed to turn on a motor using a power source, understanding some concepts of electronics, and understanding the value of spare pieces in technological trash.

That is a very desafing process because we nad to resolve how to recollect data with that specific tool. \u00b6 3.Data analysing For me, this is the most interesting topic, because I realized that is possible to make all new ways of data recolecting beyond cualitative or quantitative information.
