I realised my \u201cpersonal\u201d fight when I was doing my degree project, it s called Make Care. Its about taking care of the necesities of young people with Epidermolisis Bullosa(Cristal Skin) and a development of a set of products that tackles Daily life issues, that allows tho the young self dependancy of their caretakers, ussually fathers or family members that protect this kids in an overprotective way. The project is open source, and all objects are 3d printed, and assembled with commercial pieces, because there are 200 people with this desease in Chile, But a lot in the world, so the idea is to enable people, foundations, and hospitals, to download and link with digital fabricators, such as fablabs, maker spaces, to Connect the products with young People with EB. In this process I had discovered that my fight will be the \u201cbridge\u201d or connection beetween comunities, people, minorities, and joinig them with multidisciplinary teams, professionals, and creative people that are more used to develop and create new things. Connecting the unconnected points in the most creative, locally, efficient and resourcefull way. Some of my actual questions are: Research: -minorities -Peripherical communities -Music and social impact Design methods: How digital biofabrication can be usefull -Digital Bio-fabrication, grow it yourself materials. -Metamaterials -Music -Biomimmicry applied to design projects. https://joaquinrosas.com/MAKE-CARE 2)Your profesional Identity, Skills, Knowledge. and acttitude. \u201cPersonal development Plan\u201d Know, want I want to learn. make the switch, form passive learning to take control where i want to go, and where I want to learn. 1) Look at your poster as your design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future 2) Describe your professional identity in terms of skills, knowledge and attitude. 3) Reflect on the \u201cmeetings\u201d by analyzing what attracts you from their skills, knowledge and attitude 4) Based on your vision and what attracts you from the \u201cmeetings\u201d create your desired professional identity 5) Map the courses we are having this trimester in terms of what you have learned (for the past ones), and what you would like to learn (ones to come). 6) Justify and describe your \u201cdraft\u201d personal development plan for the master program.

Screenshots of your individual design space Why did you choose your main weak signals?How do they relate to the fight you presented one week ago? Screenshot of your Multiscalar diagram - Screenshot Reflect on your experience looking for weak signals in a situated approach though scales. Screenshots of your collaborative design space How was the experience of finding points of resonance with others? Next steps - Based on the work this week please tell me: Someone you would like to contact An experiment you\u2019d like to make A new skill you\u2019d like to add to your personal development plan","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"D 1st term: Design Bootcamp Activities: 1) Whats your fight?
